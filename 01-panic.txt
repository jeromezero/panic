I know how to calm him (he doesn't respond well to sedatives [or, not the sedatives they have on hand in the trailer]) -->

<!-- ACT FOUR: While Tank is talking with the EMTs, Daisy messes with Louis, pressing her tits in his face, teasing him, alternating between encouraging him and berating him—trying to convince him to freak out, or to take her to the fun house -->

<!-- ACT FOUR: Louis reaches his breaking point. He needs to get outside. He needs to find out what it is, exactly, he saw out there. He needs to find his old teacher. His old teacher would know whats happening to him. He would know what to do. Why did he leave me like this? -->
