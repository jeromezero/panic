Panic
======

Louis Blake (or Bartok) was part of some small cult-like group. The leader of which (the Doctor) was a con artist. He played with mystical ideas and psychobabble to lure marks into his web. Louis thought it was all authentic, but he was little more than a pawn in the Doctor's scheme for cold hard cash.

The final conclusion--closing the deal--necessitated a show of ceremony. Big showdown.

Something went wrong at the big showdown, and louis blacks out. Wakes up some time later in a lock-up situation. Psychiatric hospital? prison hospital? he doesn't know what happened, or where the Doctor is. 

Louis is a neurotic kid who's rather gullible and subject to overthinking. He gets pretty severe panic attacks now. He gets headaches and sometimes (maybe) hears voices. When he has a panic attack, he goes berserk. Blacks out. Turns into the incredible hulk, a werewolf, mr. hyde, etc.

He tries to track down the doctor to find out what happened to him. At first, he maybe wants to seek out the doctor and the rest of the little cult, because that is the only family / home he knows, but this may change as he discovers more unpleasant things about the Doc.
