# panic attack

### overarching plot

Louis Blake (or Bartok) was basically part of some small cult-like group. The leader of which (the Doctor) was a con artist. He played with mystical ideas and psychobabble to lure marks into his web. Louis thought it was all authentic, but he was little more than a pawn in the Doctor's scheme for cold hard cash.

The final con--closing the deal--necessitated a show of ceremony. Big showdown.

Something went wrong at the big showdown, and louis blacks out. Wakes up some time later in a lock-up situation. Psychiatric hospital? prison hospital? he doesn't know what happened, or where the Doctor is. 

Louis is a neurotic kid who's rather gullible and subject to overthinking. He gets pretty severe panic attacks now. He gets headaches and sometimes (maybe) hears voices. When he has a panic attack, he goes berserk. Blacks out. Turns into the incredible hulk, a werewolf, mr. hyde, etc.

He tries to track down the doctor to find out what happened to him. At first, he maybe wants to seek out the doctor and the rest of the little cult, because that is the only family / home he knows, but this may change as he discovers more unpleasant things about the Doc.

--that's the overarching plot jazz. individual episodes have their individual arcs, of course.

---

He totally overreacts to situations. This is the tragedy of his condition. He doesn't get to face demonic, powerful foes ... his strength is not evenly matched against the strength of his opponents, his strength and the violence of his reactions totally dwarf the situations to which they apply.

combine the berserker with the thriller where we have no payoffs, the constantly discarded checkov's gun. we set up thriller tropes and don't live up to them. bait and switch. Wait a minute. This isn't the way to the airport! Danger ... driver out to get me ... blood rising ... collar. feels. tight. too tight. back of my hands itch terribly. What's that smell? it's the driver's meal from last night, completely described in thorough detail but I've ... only ... smelled his flatulence. My sense of smell is getting powerfull. Adrenaline surging. Feel strong. Ready for violence. Extreme hunger for ultra-rare meats. Here it comes! ... Oh wait, this actually *is* the way to the airport. I guess I got a little turned around.

okay, i'll be fine. Just breathe for a minute.

but if that's the condition, he needs some powerful conflict to come from somewhere else. Then the pulp action stuff becomes peripheral, it becomes more about the horror of what he does to people who don't deserve that kind of treatment ... 

it becomes more of a story about "I must resist the urge to freak the fuck out / I must master my own demons" becomes the central conflict / issue, rather than of the 'toughguy whoops bad guy's ass' paradigm

## Episode One




### spin

Louis comes out of a blackout to find himself in the middle of some kind of interview. A job interview? An oral exam? a press thing (is he the interviewer or the interviewee?)? he is in conversation with someone, but doesn't know the dynamic of the relationship. Tries to figure it out and play the situation to his best interests. Ideally our conception of the power relationship would shift once or twice as the episode progressed (who's on top? is it louis? yes! wait, no. it's Tank! whaaat? it isn't tank, but it's actually louis. This is tooo much. And of course, it isn't louis after all. I can see where this is going--oh wait. Louis isn't handling this very well. He's losing his cool (not in a violent way, but in an embarassing and over the top way). he does something wildly inapropriate, but not necessarily a tough-guy move. He pees in the corner--just whips it out and pees in a trashcan in front of everybody. And just as everybody is brushing themselves off and nervously laughing about what a weak social misfit Louis is ... he goes berserk.

### spin two

Louis comes out of a blackout, and he is working a menial office job. He's in the middle of a shift, perhaps talking to someone on the phone and all of the sudden, it hits him. What is he doing here? how did he get here? a desk job? that doesn't make any sense. Louis has always been a vagabond. what is he doing working in this office?

<!-- looking at the 02 bit, he could be in a hospital. he could be trying to meet with an actual doctor -->
