<!-- As the moon rises, Durward locks a stray dog in the cell with Louis. -->

<!-- The voices in Louis' head: "Look away. You aren't ready for this." -->

Louis Blake feels great.

<!-- He is covered in blood. He feels amazing. Like, really good. He doesn't feel sick at all. He doesn't feel hurt. But his hands are all sticky. His face is sticky. There is fur caught between his teeth. He gags and coughs up a wad of fur. A hairball?  -->


It's been a while since he felt like this. It's been ... but Louis doesn't want to think about how long it's been. He doesn't want to think about much. 

It isn't that he's scared of where the thinking might take him. It just seems like a waste of time. His thoughts can be anywhere right now, and it won't really matter. It wouldn't *mean* anything. Nothing *means* anything. Nothing matters. 



<!-- Coughing up hairballs, wads of fur, black like the puppy ... -->

<!-- He doesn't feel sad or disgusted. Where is the puppy? Who cares? He should care. There is blood all over him. It looks like he has killed the thing. Torn it to bits ... but he can't bring himself to feel remorse or shame or anything negative at all. He is full of energy. -->

<!-- He has never felt better, really. -->


Louis laughs. He laughs and ignores the men that come into the room to remove the remains of the small puppy.

Louis laughs at how scared he's been. It strikes him as funny, how much weight and import he's put into things. How much fear he's had in him. Fear of what he's seen, fear of what he's lost. Fear of what is growing inside his mind. Fear of some passenger he's picked up along the way. Fear of what he might become. Fear of what he might be already. Fear of not being able to live a normal life. Fear of the illness he's carried as long as he's been alive, or as long as he can remember, at least.

He's been paralyzed by sadness. By the loss of his mother. He's been holding so much inside him, locked away in his head, piled up on his shoulders. But why?

He's been looking at it all wrong. There's no difference. It's all the same organic matter smashing into itself, with or without Louis. With or without the anxiety or emotion. Dust colliding with dust. A chance slime of algae in the vast emptiness of space. The infinite, unknowable universe, and everything Louis ever loved or feared or was or will be is here and now in this mote of dust. 

No one is watching.  

Or are they?

Even if they are, it doesn't matter.

<!-- 
Louis' skin is clear. His vision better. His hearing is great. Everything smells so delicious and clear. He is hungry. He wants to eat. He is full of energy. He wants to run. To see the outside. To feel the air on his face. To look at the schizoprhagma in the garden.

He tries to leave, to go outside, but he isn't able to. 

There is nothing. There is only silence and a locked door. Cold stone. He begins to feel frustration and guilt and shame creeping in at the edges of his awareness. He fights against them. He knows that if he can get outside and run, he will be fine. There will be no sorrow, no suffering. But he can't get outside. The door is locked. 

There is no door that can hold me, he thinks. Not when I feel like this.

But still ... he is unable to get out. His feelings belie him, or lead him astray. He doesn't want to face the consequences of the blood on his hands, of the fur in his teeth. He wants to get out and let the fury of strenuous activity wash him clean. He wants to bathe. In the showers, in the open air. Under the light of the silvery moon.

His mood begins to sour. He can't help it. The feeling of invulnerability and purity begins to fade and the silence of the place replaces the roaring of blood in his ears. The joyful roaring of blood is replaced by the mournful, accusatory, accusative silence. 

I know, says the silence.

And the voices come back.

He doesn't understand them at first. And later, he wishes he did not understand them.

And the questions begin.  -->

---

Are the voices in Louis' head? He thinks so, at first, but he soon comes to understand that they are being piped in over a P.A. system

The doctor tries to tell him that it is only natural. That it is only Louis, after all, that everything going on inside of him is a natural part of his own condition. He has been through trauma, and he must react to it in particular ways. He must process the trauma in whatever way he can.

The doctor tells him about a study of rats. The scientists shock and prod and torture the rats. They stimulate them so that their adrenal glands are always working. They push their stress responses to work overtime. Rats left to process this stimulation alone are overwhelmed by the stress. They suffer from high blood pressure. They die of heart attacks. They die soon. They die young. But rats who are kept in proximity to other rats are able to normalize their stress response by enacting aggressive, hostile or violent behavior toward the other rats. 

Rats that are able to beat the shit out of other rats are not prone to suffer high blood pressure and die of heart attacks before their time.

The aggressive response is a healthy response, and it keeps them from killing themselves.

What? And I should kill others, instead of dealing with what I've been through? Louis asks?

No ... This is a part of *how* you deal with what you've bee through, the doctor tells him.

It sounds horrible, I know. But you aren't alone. There is another here who is like you. There is another who knows what it is like, who knows what you are going through.

Pain and suffering are a part of daily life, they are a part of the cycle of life. There is no growth without death. There is no need to torture yourself. Yes ... unnecessary cruelty is deplorable ... but cruelty, in some degree, is necessary. This is a natural part of life. It is what must be done, to keep you from eating yourself alive. Do you see? Your sickness ...

My sickness?

"It's time for you to go in," Doctor Bellamy says to Shannon Ulger. "Talk to him. He's ready for you."

"You're not listening to me," Shannon says. "Somethings not right with him."

"Of course there's something wrong with him. That's why he's here. You can help him through this. It's a miracle we've found him, Shannon. Doesn't it feel good to know you aren't alone? This is our last chance, Shannon. Durward will be back to take him soon. I can't keep her at bay for long."

"Let her take him, then."

"Not yet. We need to see it happen. Think how much we could learn, how much--"

"Wasn't that enough? He tore the puppy apart with his bare hands."

"But he didn't ... change. His bare hands couldn't inflict wounds like we saw at the fair[^ep01]."

"You're not listening to me, Doctor. He's not the same--"

<!-- Bellamy believes it is the only holistic approach. Louis needs to learn to embrace the difficult parts of him so that he can integrate the symptoms of his ailments ... but ... -->

"No, Shannon. You are not listening to me. This could be our last chance with him. Get in there and talk to the boy."

"One day, the sun will run out of hydrogen and its core will collapse upon itself," Louis says. "This collapsing will cause what's left of the sun to burn hotter. The core will collapse, but the outer layers will expand. The sun will turn red as blood and swell to one hundred times its current size, engulfing the earth and much of the solar system in the process."

Louis is sitting cross-legged on the floor, covering his face in his hands and rocking gently back and forth as he chuckles softly to himself. He doesn't seem to notice as Shannon enters the room and closes the door behind him. The latch clicks, but no one on the outside drops the reinforced bar back into place.

Shannon sits down on the floor across from Louis and offers a warm, moist towel, holding it out to Louis to take. 

Louis doesn't acknowledge the offer.

"For the blood," Shannon says, miming a face-wiping gesture. "I'll leave it here. But ... it's nicer when it's warm. It's the small comforts, you know."

Shannon sniffs the air uncertainly before continuing.

"There's a thing the Buddhists say that kind of reminds me of what you were just talking about. I ... overheard you as I was coming up the hall. They say: If you have a teacup that is very precious to you, you have two choices. 

"You can be obsessively careful with it, doing everything you can to protect it, to make sure it is handled properly, that no one comes along and mistreats it or breaks it or chips its finish. But this way, the teacup, which is meant to bring you pleasure, can instead become a burden and a source of anxiety."

While Shannon speaks, Louis stops chuckling. He drops his hands into his lap and looks into Shannon's face, cocking his head slightly to the side.  

"The other option is to live as if the teacup is already broken. And in a sense--in a particularly Buddhist sense--it already is broken. Someday ... inevitably ... it *will* break. If you come to terms with this and accept the ultimate fate of the teacup, it can be really liberating. You can free yourself to truly enjoy each moment you spend with it, every time you drink from the cup, you can appreciate it without the fear of it's loss, for you've already said goodbye."

"My mother used to tell me something similar," Louis says. "When I was scared of being sick. Scared of dying. 'Drink from the cup like it's already broken,' she'd say. But how can you drink from a broken cup? How can you live when you are already dead?"

<!-- PLOT: Louis has a showdown with Shannon Ulger --> 


<!-- Shannon and Louis come face to face, and they are like wild animals thrust into a cage. Reason is out the window.  -->

<!-- PLOT: Louis and Shannon go out of their heads.  Like two territorial creatures forced into a too-small cage --> 

<!-- Hackles are raised. They are at each others throats, and they bolt. Smashing though a door and a window, they disappear into the night. -->

<!-- PLOT: They fight.  Break things.  Louis smashes through a window and disappears out into the night -->

Louis snarls, bares his teeth and leaps for Shannon.

"Not again!" Shannon says, putting up his hands just in time to cover his throat as Louis smashes into him, knocking him back onto the floor.

But Shannon is ready for Louis this time. His eyes gleam hot orange yellow. He sinks sharp teeth into Louis' shoulder and kicks at him, his body curling and uncurling in unnatural ways. Shannon's clothes are torn as his spine twists and stretches. His long limbs flex and his joints pop and he moves in ways that seem beyond human. He lashes out with tooth and claw and looses all sense of reason, of up or down. 

They overturn the cot and smash the light bulb in the ceiling.

Louis flies back against the door, kicked by Shannon. The reinforced bar hasn't been dropped into place, and the door is knocked off its hinges. 

Louis rolls to his feet in the hallway, blood dripping from his mouth and a large gash in his chest.

"From your toenails? Cut your toenails," Louis says.

Shannon's eyes flash in the darkness of the room. He growls and leaps out into the hall after Louis. His body is gnarly and twisted. He barely looks human. He leads with his head. Butting into Louis' chest. The wind whistles through Shannon's deviated septum and snot sprays as his teeth gnash and click as his mouth snaps shut on a bit of Louis' belly fat.

Louis screams and pounds the bottom of his fists into the back of Shannon's neck. He pulls at the hair that he never noticed before, but now seems to grow all over Shannon's back. 

Louis twists and breaks free and the two of them smash back and forth across the hall. They fly through the wire-reinforced window at the end of the hall and fall out into the twilight.
