### scene titlecard goes here

It is time to get Louis out into the world. This episode sees him break from the asylum. A scene parallel to the first episode, where Louis is running through the woods, underdressed--if not totally naked--and in fear of his life, hazy in his head. Not sure of where he has been or where he is going. Where does he come from? What has he been through?

He is covered in blood. He feels amazing. Like, really good. He doesn't feel sick at all. He doesn't feel hurt. But his hands are all sticky. His face is sticky. There is fur caught between his teeth. He gags and coughs up a wad of fur. A hairball? 

Fur, black like the puppy ...

He doesn't feel sad or disgusted. Where is the puppy? Who cares? He should care. There is blood all over him. It looks like he has killed the thing. Torn it to bits ... but he can't bring himself to feel remorse or shame or anything negative at all. He is full of energy.

He has never felt better, really.

His skin is clear. His vision better. His hearing is great. Everything smells so delicious and clear. He is hungry. He wants to eat. He is full of energy. He wants to run. To see the outside. To feel the air on his face. To look at the schizoprhagma in the garden.

He tries to leave, to go outside, but he isn't able to. 

There is nothing. There is only silence and a locked door. Cold stone. He begins to feel frustration and guilt and shame creeping in at the edges of his awareness. He fights against them. He knows that if he can get outside and run, he will be fine. There will be no sorrow, no suffering. But he can't get outside. The door is locked. 

There is no door that can hold me, he thinks. Not when I feel like this.

But still ... he is unable to get out. His feelings belie him, or lead him astray. He doesn't want to face the consequences of the blood on his hands, of the fur in his teeth. He wants to get out and let the fury of strenuous activity wash him clean. He wants to bathe. In the showers, in the open air. Under the light of the silvery moon.

His mood begins to sour. He can't help it. The feeling of invulnerability and purity begins to fade and the silence of the place replaces the roaring of blood in his ears. The joyful roaring of blood is replaced by the mournful, accusatory, accusative silence. 

I know, says the silence.

And the voices come back.

He doesn't understand them at first. And later, he wishes he did not understand them.

And the questions begin. 

The staff of the place ... Durward ... others perhaps ... interrogate him. Push him to answer questions he isn't prepared to answer. They test him in difficult, painful ways. They treat him unkind, they are cruel.

They underestimate him.

Shanon begs to be kept apart from him.

Bellamy reminds Shanon of what it was like for him when he first came.

But things are different. We aren't the same ...

A gruelling interview forces Louis to confront something terrible inside him. Something monstrous.

The doctor tries to tell him that it is only natural. That it is only Louis, after all, that everything going on inside of him is a natural part of his own condition. He has been through trauma, and he must react to it in particular ways. He must process the trauma in whatever way he can.

The doctor tells him about a study of rats. The scientists shock and prod and torture the rats. They stimulate them so that their adrenal glands are always working. They push their stress responses to work overtime. Rats left to process this stimulation alone are overwhelmed by the stress. They suffer from high blood pressure. They die of heart attacks. They die soon. They die young. But rats who are kept in proximity to other rats are able to normalize their stress response by enacting aggressive, hostile or violent behaviour toward the other rats. 

Rats that are able to beat the shit out of other rats are not prone to suffer high blood pressure and die of heart attacks before their time.

The aggressive response is a healthy response, and it keeps them from killing themselves.

What? And I should kill others, instead of dealing with what I've been through? Louis asks?

No ... This is a part of *how* you deal with what you've bee through, the doctor tells him.

It sounds horrible, I know. But you aren't alone. There is another here who is like you. There is another who knows what it is like, who knows what you are going through.

Pain and suffering are a part of daily life, they are a part of the cycle of life. There is no growth without death. There is no need to torture yourself. Yes ... unnecessary cruelty is deplorable ... but cruelty, in some degree, is necessary. This is a natural part of life. It is what must be done, to keep you from eating yourself alive. Do you see? Your sickness ...

My sickness?

Talk to Shanon.

So Bellamy forces Louis and Shanon together. Shanon is increasingly nervous about the whole thing. 

Bellamy is feeling self-important and righteous as he pushes the encounter forward.

Durward does not want the thing to move like this.

Bellamy believes it is the only holistic approach. Louis needs to learn to embrace the difficult parts of him so that he can integrate the symptoms of his ailments ... but ...

Shannon and Louis come face to face, and they are like wild animals thrust into a cage. Reason is out the window. 

Hackles are raised. They are at each other's throats, and they bolt. Smashing though a door and a window, they disappear into the night.
