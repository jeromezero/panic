<!-- As the moon rises, Durward locks a stray dog in the cell with Louis. -->

<!-- The voices in Louis' head: "Look away. You aren't ready for this." -->

## Into the Night

Louis Blake feels great.

For the first time, he tries to open the door of his room. But the door is locked.

There are no windows, but he imagines he can feel, through the walls, the sun setting over the hills to the west and the moon rising in the east.

<!-- more -->

He spreads his arms wide and opens his palms. He
feels himself to be an axis, a fulcrum, a center point, pulled in opposite
directions by the heavenly bodies of sun and moon. 

He is overcome by a giddy vertigo. He can feel the turning of
the earth. Everything is spinning and pulling and twisting around him, and he is still, unmoving at the center of existence.

He laughs and pivots his body at the waist, pushing down his westerly hand, forcing the sun below the horizon while he lifts his hand in the east, drawing up the moonrise. He slows, and time slows. He pushes them back the other way, lifting the sun over the rim of the horizon and pushing the moon back down.

He laughs at the ridiculousness and vainglory of his gesturing, but he continues to bend his waist with his arms outstretched. He makes airplane noises, flapping his lips together as he banks back and
forth. He is up in the sky now, looking down on the Seven
Oaks compound. He laughs as he dives down over the trees, coming in
for a low pass. He buzzes the garden. Other residents stammer and stare up at
him. Some of them fall to the ground as he passes overhead, overwhelmed by
the weight of his passing.

"I didn't mean to frighten you," Louis says to the whimpering black puppy in
the corner of the room. 

The puppy whines and tries to back away from him, it's little claws scratching and scrabbling as they slide across the wet concrete floor.

"Don't feel bad, little guy," Louis says. He picks the puppy up out of the
puddle of urine and holds it close to his chest, oblivious to the cold, oblivious to the wet. He strokes the puppy's fur back and forth. 
The whimpering puppy shakes harder.

"Shh," Louis says, wrapping his hand around the dog's snout and forcing it
to look him in the eye.  "Stop your whining. One day, the sun will run out of hydrogen and its core will collapse upon itself.  What do you think about that?  But that's not how it ends.  The collapsing will cause what's left of the sun to burn hotter.  The core will collapse, but the outer layers will expand.  The sun will turn red as blood and swell until it swallows the earth."

Louis hears a voice whispering softly in his ear: "Look away. Look away,
Louis. You aren't ready for this."

He feels, but doesn't feel, the small animal's spine crack under the pressure of his twisting grip.

He hears, but doesn't hear, the whimper of fear overrun by a yelp of pain.

But the sun won't stop there, the sun will keep on expanding until it is more than two hundred fifty times its current size, and all the inner planets are consumed.

Doctor Bellamy watches Louis on a television monitor. 

"Are you ready, Shannon?" He asks.

Shannon Ulger shakes his head. He absent-mindedly fingers the edge of the
blood-crusted bandage over his neck. "You're making a mistake," he says.

DISEMBODIED VOICE:

> It's okay to laugh, Louis. You don't have to feel shame. It's perfectly
> all right. The violent imperative is a legitimate and justifiable biological response.

LOUIS: 

> What's happening to me?

VOICE:

> You are discovering who you really are.

LOUIS:

> And who am I?

VOICE:

> You are a beautiful creature, Louis. A beautiful, tortured creature. And you've been afraid for too long.

LOUIS:

> Afraid? And what was I afraid of? 

VOICE:

> Everything. You've been afraid for as long as you can remember. Afraid of being Sick. Afraid of dying. Afraid of not being able to live a normal life. But you were afraid of living too. Weren't you? Afraid of your mother. Afraid of packing the car. Afraid of trying experimental treatment after experimental treatment, knowing that nothing would work. You were afraid of disappointing your mother.

LOUIS:

> Disappointing her?

VOICE:

> By not getting better. By wasting her time and her money. Her hard earned money, Louis. She gave everything so she could help you. So you could be *healed.* But you fear you will never be healed, Louis. Aren't you? She taught you to keep yourself locked away. She taught you to be afraid to look inside, to discover who you really are. She knew what you are capable of, But she couldn't face it. She couldn't admit it to herself, and she couldn't admit it to you. Could she? She thought she could cure you, to clear away that core of yourself that you've locked away so deep inside ... and for what? What has it brought you, Louis? The years of lying to your mother. Of lying to yourself. Has anything good come of it? It's time to accept who you are. Look around you. You are the corpse of the animal you could be. Death is a part of life, Louis. It lives within you. This is who you are. You aren't a monster. You are a divine instrument.

Louis stands up and shakes the voices from his head. He paces back and forth across the locked room.

There's no difference. Nothing matters. The whole of the world ... all the people in it ... it's all just the same
organic matter smashing into itself, with or without Louis.  Anxiety and emotion are just little made-up things that people tell themselves when they are looking out at all the lifeless dust of it all. Lies. There is nothing but dust. Dust colliding with dust.  Life is nothing but a chance slime of algae in the vast emptiness of space.  The infinite, unknowable universe, and
everything Louis ever loved or feared or was or will be is here and now in
this irreconcilable smudge of nothingness.

---

Louis is covered in blood. 

He can't remember the last time he felt so good. It's been ... but Louis doesn't want to think about how long it's been.  He doesn't want to think about much.

Louis looks at his hands. His sticky, red hands. There is a carcass by the
locked and bolted door. Broken spine, small canine skull, bits of still-warm
flesh.

But Louis can't bring himself to feel remorse or shame or anything negative
at all.

Louis laughs. He laughs and stops suddenly, looking at his hands.


---

<!-- Louis' skin is clear. Clearer than it has ever been. His vision is better. His hearing acute. Everything smells so strong and clear and delicious. He is hungry. Louis wants to eat.  -->

He wants to move around. How long has he been in this little room? He can't remember. He wants to get outside. The sun has set, hasn't it? The moon is up, isn't it? Louis wants to look up into the sky and ... to watch the the last rays of light pour from they dying sun. To feel the silver spray of the newborn moon fall onto his skin.

For the first time, Louis tries the door to the room. But the door is locked. Louis' muscles are itching to move. He's tired of these four walls.  

There is nothing. There is only silence and a locked door. Cold concrete floor. 
z
Frustration, guilt and shame creep in at the edges of
his awareness.  He fights them. If he can get outside
and run, he will be fine.  There will be no sorrow, no suffering.  
He tries the door, but the door is locked.

There is no door that can hold me, Louis thinks. Not when I feel like this.

He charges at the door, ramming it with his shoulder. But the door hardly shakes. A disappointingly soft thud is all that rewards his effort. He tries again. He its harder. Over and over, he smashes his body into the door, but the door remains closed.

---

VOICE:

> A rat, living in a hostile environment ... exposed to prolonged physical trauma ... has a choice: He can take his punishment passively, and die from  stress overload; or he can relay the trauma ... passing it on to another rat through hostility, violence, or murder ... and survive the experience without detrimental effect--he can thrive, even.

> The violent imperative is a powerful one. But it is a natural impulse. Natural and necessary--particularly in your situation. You have been through a lot of Trauma, Louis. 


---

LOUIS: 

> So I should condone murder, instead of coming to terms with what I've been through? 

---

<!-- Louis searches for the source of the voice.  -->

<!-- NOTE: this passage = not so good. should show the transition from belief the voice is an inner force or hallucination to realization or suspicion that it is an external voice, transmitted to him through the environment. -->

<!-- He had been convinced the voice had been speaking from within his head, but now he isn't so sure. -->

"You aren't alone," the voice continues. "There is another here like you.  He knows what it is like, what you are going through."

Louis recognizes the voice.

"Doctor?" Louis says. "Doctor ... Bellamy?"

There are several perforated panels on the ceiling. One in each corner of the room. Electronic speakers for the P.A. system.

The doctor's voice crackles out of the speakers. "Pain and suffering are a part of daily life," he says. "They are a part of the natural order of things.  There is no growth without death. Cruelty is necessary. It is a healing force.  To keep you from eating yourself alive.  Do you see?  Your sickness is...."

Louis tries the door for the first time, but the door is locked and bolted and he cannot open it, no matter how hard he pulls. "My sickness?" he says.

---

"It's time for you to go in," Doctor Bellamy says to Shannon Ulger. "Talk to
him.  He's ready for you."

"You're not listening to me," Shannon says. "Somethings not right with him."

"Of course there's something wrong with him. That's why he's here. You can
help him through this.  It's a miracle we've found him, Shannon. And I think he can help you too.  
Doesn't it feel good to know you aren't alone?  This is our last chance, Shannon. Durward will be back to take him away soon. She won't be delayed again."

"Let her take him, then."

"Not yet. We need to see it happen. Think how much we could learn, how
much--"

"Wasn't that enough? He tore the dog apart with his bare hands. What else do you want from him?"

"He didn't ... change. His bare hands couldn't inflict wounds like we
saw at the fair[^ep01]."

[^ep01]: see [episode one](http://www.caligopress.com/2014/05/panic-attacks-episode-01.html) 

"You're not listening to me, Doctor. He's not the same--"

"No, Shannon. You are not listening to me. This could be our last chance
with him. Get in there and talk to the boy."

---

Louis is sitting cross-legged on the floor, covering his face in his hands and rocking gently back and forth and chuckling softly.  He doesn't seem to notice as Shannon enters the room and closes the door behind him.  The latch clicks, but no one on the outside drops the reinforced bar back into place.

Shannon sits down on the floor next to Louis and offers a warm, moist towel, holding it out to Louis to take.

Louis doesn't acknowledge the offer.

"For the blood," Shannon says, miming a face-wiping gesture. "I'll leave it
here.  But ...  it's nicer when it's warm.  It's the small comforts, you
know."

Shannon sniffs the air uncertainly before continuing.

"There's a thing the Buddhists say: If you have a teacup that is very precious to you, you have two choices," he says. "You can be obsessively careful with it, doing everything you can to protect it, to make sure it is handled properly, that no one comes along and mistreats it or breaks it or chips its finish.  But this way, the teacup, which is meant to bring you pleasure, can instead become a burden and a source of anxiety."

While Shannon speaks, Louis stops chuckling. He drops his hands into his lap
and looks into Shannon's face, cocking his head slightly to the side.

"The other option is to live as if the teacup is already broken. And in a
sense--in a particularly Buddhist sense--it already is broken.  Someday ... 
inevitably ...  it *will* break.  If you come to terms with this and accept
the ultimate fate of the teacup, you are liberated. You are free to truly enjoy each moment you spend with it. Every time you drink from the cup, you appreciate it without the fear of it's loss, for you've already said goodbye."

"My mother used to tell me something similar," Louis says. "When I was
scared of being sick. Scared of dying. But how can you drink from a broken cup?  How can you live when you are already dead?"

---

As Louis talks, a deep growl rises in his throat. 

"Not again!" Shannon says, the air whistling through his nose. He gets to his feet and cautiously backs away from Louis.

Louis snarls, bares his teeth, leaps for Shannon and smashes into him,  knocking him back onto the floor.

But Shannon is ready for Louis this time. His eyes gleam hot orange yellow.
He sinks sharp teeth into Louis' shoulder and kicks at him, his body curling
and uncurling in unnatural ways.  Shannon's clothes are torn as his spine
twists and stretches.  His long limbs flex and his joints pop and he moves
in ways that seem beyond human.  He lashes out with tooth and claw and
looses all sense of reason, of up or down.

They overturn the cot and smash the light bulb in the ceiling.

Louis flies back against the door, kicked by Shannon. The reinforced bar
hasn't been dropped into place, and the door is knocked off its hinges.

Louis rolls to his feet in the hallway, blood dripping from his mouth and a
large gash in his chest.

Shannon's eyes flash in the darkness of the room. He growls and leaps out
into the hall after Louis.  His body is gnarly and twisted.  He barely looks
human.  He leads with his head.  Butting into Louis' chest.  The wind
whistles through Shannon's deviated septum and snot sprays as his teeth
gnash and click as his mouth snaps shut on a bit of Louis' belly fat.

Louis screams and pounds the bottom of his fists into the back of Shannon's
neck.  He pulls at the hair that he never noticed before, but now seems to
grow all over Shannon's back.

Louis twists and breaks free and the two of them smash back and forth across
the hall.  They fly through the wire-reinforced window at the end of the
hall and fall out into the twilight.
