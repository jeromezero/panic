<p>Again, Louis sat in a garden. But this was a very different garden. A private space. A space for himself, a space he had never before shared with anyone.</p>
<p>It was a lush, rich garden, with towering old oaks. Didn’t those used to be ash trees? Louis thought they had been, but he couldn’t quite remember. He rubbed his eyes and stood up. Yes … there they were, a grove of seven oak trees, spreading out, as if to surround the garden.</p>
<p>Flowering vines clung to the gnarled old trunks. Moonlight Schizophragma.</p>
<p>“Describe your surroundings,” said a voice somewhere far away. Doctor Bellamy’s voice.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” Louis said. “Something’s changed.”</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>“Is that unusual?” the doctor asked.</p>
<p>“No. It’s normally … I … yes, it is unusual. Normally, it’s different. I mean, it’s the same. It’s always the same. But now … I am standing in the middle of the garden. The air is warm and still. Along the path, there are stones laid into the ground. Stepping stones. Just beyond the roses, a grove of trees. They have always been ash trees, I think. With almond shaped leaves. When the wind blows, helicopter seeds come spinning down over the garden. At least … that’s how it was. But now …”</p>
<p>“Many people, when they visit an inner refuge, like your garden, they often find little … manifestations, or representations of things that have been on their minds … or otherwise in their lives.”</p>
<p>“No. Not here. This place … this is the place where my mother and my father … she told me about it. I never saw it, but it’s always been the way she described it. The way I pictured it. The way I imagined. It’s always the same, when I come here. The same day. The same flowers in bloom. The same gentle breeze. But now … no breeze. The air is … heavy. The trees are different. The flowers …”</p>
<p>“Relax, Louis. Take a few deep breaths. Settle into the tranquility of the garden. Let the calm, let the peace of it wash over–”</p>
<p>“Please. Stop that. I don’t need you to guide me through this. You wanted me to show you where I hid the mirror.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Louis. I’d like for you to show me the mirror.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>“I believe it was an important thing for you, this moment when you buried it away.”</p>
<p>“I buried it because it is dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Your mother told you it was dangerous.”</p>
<p>“She saw what it did to my father.”</p>
<p>“I know you are uncomfortable, Louis, but you are going to have to trust me. The Seven Oaks Asylum can be good for you. It <em>will</em> be good for you, but it will take work. Trust is the first step, Louis. Let me in. You are safe here, Louis. Nothing can hurt you. Let me in. Show me, and I will show you: our fears and memories are not half so dangerous as we believe, once we look them in the eye.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know what’s down there.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t know either, Louis. That’s the point. What frightened you as a child … time and fear have a way of tricking the memory, of transforming it.”</p>
<p>“I will show you. But I’ve only ever been alone here. If you could … stop talking … just listen, please. I’ll show you where it’s buried.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The air is still. The sweet scent … flowers or … decay … is heavy. It is not humid. It is not dry. But there is something … some weight pressing in on me. I cannot see the sun. The sky is gray and blank. There are no shadows. The light comes from … not everywhere, but maybe … it comes from everywhere. It is heavy, like the air. It presses in, presses down on my skin. I can feel its weight on my face, pressing my eyelids down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am walking now, between the oak trees. Following the narrow dirt path. It winds out of the garden, toward the gully. Grasses give way to shrubs and evergreens. Walls of broken stone rise to either side. There are still no shadows, but the air is even thicker, more difficult to penetrate. I have been here before, but I don’t recognize anything. It’s been a long time, and … that isn’t right, exactly. I recognize something … but I can’t quite pinpoint what it is. There is something familiar about the place, but …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A murmuring simmer of dejas-vu in the back of my head buzzes like the insects that I should be hearing. But I’m not. The insects are conspicuously absent. It is so quiet. It is overgrown, but … something has been here recently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Green ends of broken branches poke out at me. A tree, fallen across the path, is … torn apart. Splinters of fresh wood are everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The buzzing in my head is getting louder. There is a smell. A strong smell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am nearing the entrance to the cave. It was hidden. Years before, I hid it, piled rocks one by one. The rocks are scattered now. And smashed. Fresh rock-dust coats the leaves of sage brush. I had nailed boards across the entrance, years before …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mirror is inside. I locked it up years ago. I nailed boards to the old support beams. I piled rocks in front of the boards. I poured dirt and earth over the rocks so that the entrance disappeared into the hillside. But now … the earth and dirt are gone. Eroded. Washed away. The stones are scattered, the pile reduced to nothing. The boards are smashed. Broken and splintered like the tree fallen across the path. The broken edges are fresh …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Smashed outward? Has something escaped?” the doctor’s voice betrayed concern.</p>
<p>“No,” Louis said. “The boards have been smashed <em>in.</em> Something has broken *in.“*</p>
