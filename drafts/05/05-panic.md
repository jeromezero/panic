## PANIC attacks episode 05

Again, Louis sat in a garden. But this was a very different garden. A private space. A space for himself, a space he had never before shared with anyone. 

It was a lush, rich garden, with towering old oaks. Didn't those used to be alder trees? Louis thought they had been, but he couldn't quite remember. They certainly weren't oaks, were they? He rubbed his eyes and stood up. Yes ... there they were, a grove of seven oak trees in a loose cluster off to one side of the garden. 

Flowering vines climbed the gnarled old trees. Moonlight Schizophragma. 

"Describe your surroundings," said a voice somewhere far outside the garden. It was Doctor Bellamy's voice.

"Hang on," Louis said. "It's changed."

"And what has changed about it?" the doctor asked. "Is that unusual?"

"No. It's normally ... I ... yes, it is unusual. Normally, it's different. I mean, it's the same. It's always the same. But now ..."

"Is it because you are describing it to me?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I don't think so. I think it's something else. I don't know for sure. It's just ... I am standing in the middle of a garden. The air is warm and still. Along the paths, there are stones laid into the ground. Stepping stones. There is a grove of trees, just beyond the roses. Deciduous trees. They have always been ash trees, I think. Almond shaped leaves. When the wind blows, helicopter seeds come spinning down over the garden. At least ... that's how it was. But now ..."

"But now?"

"Now, there is a grove of Oaks. There are ... seven oak trees standing off to the ... not so much off to the side anymore. They are leaning over me. Reaching around the garden ... not surrounding it, exactly, but ... moving ... and there are flowering vines. Vines from your garden here. They were never in my garden before, but now they are."

"Many people, when they visit an inner refuge, like your garden, they often find little ... manifestations, or representations of things that have been on their minds ... or otherwise in their lives."

"No. Not here. This place ... I'm not sure, exactly--not objectively--but this garden ... this is the place where my mother and my father ... she told me about it. I never saw it, but it's always been the way she described it. The way I pictured it. The way I imagined. It's always been the same. The same day, when I come here. The same flowers in bloom. The same gentle breeze. But now ... no breeze. The air is heavy and still. Different trees. The flowers ..."

"Did our garden here have a strong impact on you? How do you feel, when you see things have changed here, in your own garden? Do you feel threatened? Invaded? Encroached upon?"

"I don't know. I shouldn't be doing this. Something is--"

"Relax, Louis. Take a few deep breaths. Settle into the tranquility of the garden. Let the calm, let the peace of it wash over--"

"Please. Stop that. I don't need you to guide me through this. You wanted me to show you how I do this. To show you where I hid the mirror."

"That's right, Louis. I'd like for you to show me the mirror."

"But you don't believe me."

"I believe it was an important thing for you, this moment when you buried it away."

"I buried it because it is dangerous."

"Your mother told you it was dangerous."

"She saw what it did to my father."

"I know you are uncomfortable, Louis, but you are going to have to trust me. This place can be good for you. It *will* be good for you, but it will take work. Trust is the first step, Louis. Let me in. You are safe here, Louis. Nothing can hurt you. Let me in. Show me, and I will show you: our fears and memories are not half so dangerous as we believe, once we look them in the eye."

"You don't know what's down there."

"And you don't know either, Louis. That's what I'm telling you. What frightened you as a child ... time and fear have a way of tricking the memory, of transforming it."

"I can show you. But I've only ever been alone here. If you could ... stop talking ... just listen, please. I'll show you where it's buried."

> The air is still. The sweet scent ... flowers or ... decay ... is heavy. It is not humid. It is not dry. But there is something ... some weight pressing in on me. I cannot see the sun. The sky is gray and blank. There are no shadows. The light comes from ... not everywhere, but maybe ... it comes from everywhere. It is heavy, like the air. It presses in, presses down on my skin. I can feel its weight on my face, pressing my eyelids down.

> I am walking now, between the oak trees. Following the narrow dirt path. It winds out of the garden, toward the gully. Grasses give way to shrubs and evergreens. Walls of broken stone rise to either side. There are still no shadows, but the air is even thicker, more difficult to penetrate. I have been here before, but I don't recognize anything. It's been a long time, and ... that isn't right, exactly. I recognize something ... but I can't quite pinpoint what it is. There is something oddly familiar about the place, but ... 

> A murmuring simmer of dejas-vu in the back of my head buzzes like the insects that I should be hearing. The conspicuously absent insects. It is so quiet. It is overgrown, but ... something has been here. 

> Green ends of broken branches poke out at me. A tree, fallen across the path, is ... torn apart. Splinters of fresh wood are everywhere.

> The buzzing in my head is louder now. There is a smell. A strong smell. 

> I am nearing the entrance to the cave. It was hidden. Years before, I hid it, piled rocks one by one. The obscuring rocks have been scattered and smashed. Fresh rock-dust coats the leaves of sage brush. I had nailed boards across the entrance, years before ...

> The mirror is inside. Locked it away years ago. I nailed boards to the old support beams. I piled rocks in front of the boards. I poured dirt and earth over the rocks so that the entrance disappeared into the hillside. But now ... the earth and dirt are gone. Eroded. Washed away. The stones are scattered, the pile reduced to nothing. The boards are smashed. Broken and splintered like the tree fallen across the path. The broken edges are fresh ...

"Smashed outward? Has something escaped?" the doctor's voice betrays concern.

"No," Louis says. "The boards have been smashed *in.* Something has broken *in."*
