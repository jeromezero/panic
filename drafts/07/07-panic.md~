The voices in Louis' head: "look away. You aren't ready for this."

Louis has dark dreams. He doesn't see the light for days. He clutches his
knees to his chest and rocks back and forth in the darkness. The voice
inside him isn't a voice. It is a sound. It is a texture. It is a desire. It
slowly builds up and threatens to overwhelm him. It manifests in fits of
giggling. He sits in the dark, scratching at his skin until it bleeds and
clutches his knees to his raw and bloodied chest and he collapses into fits
of terrible giggling. 

Nothing is funny. He knows this. He doesn't laugh out of humor. He doesn't
really laugh at all. He convulses. He shakes and retches, but it all comes
out as laughter. He doesn't laugh, but it comes out that way.

He dreams of the open road. He dreams of the ground beneath his feet. He
dreams of running. Of feeling the spongey grass-covered earth of the open
plains beneath his feet as his strides stretch out longer and longer. He
covers great expanses of land as he flies through the night. He is naked in
his dreams. He chases the setting sun. He is sure that he might catch it,
just over the next rise, so he runs faster, he flies farther. But it stays
beyond his reach.

You can't catch the sun, he thinks.

But he tries.

He wakes up in a twisted knot on the floor. Drenched in cold sweat. The
straight jacket is gone. He doesn't remember its removal. The floor is cold,
but there are wool blankets tangled up at his feet. He wipes himself with
them. They stink. The wool scratches at him, catches on the scabs of his
rubbed-raw chest. It stings.

"Hello?" he says into the emptiness of the dark room. 

No one answers him.

Louis resists the surging, gag-like waves of muscle contractions rising up
from his guts. He feels nauseous.

A low panel in the door slides open with a clang. 

"Hello?" Louis calls again. His voice is a quavering, broken croak.

Large black-gloved hands shove something through the opening in the door. 

"Hey ... puppy," Louis says. 

The panel slams shut and a deadbold drops into place. The puppy, a small
black pug, whimpers.

Louis reaches a hand toward the little, fragile-seeming thing.

"Aren't you a ... precious ... little ... thing?"

The puppy backs away, squealing, its tail tucked between its legs. It shakes
and cries and pees on its feet.

Louis gags and convulses and coughs out a chortle. He clamps his hands over
his mouth, tries to cover it, but the fingers find their way inside and he
digs at his gums and pulls at his cheeks and he gnaws at his fingers and he
laughs and howls and laughs.
