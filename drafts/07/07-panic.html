<h3 id="int.-bellamys-office---day">INT. BELLAMY’S OFFICE - DAY</h3>
<p>Rain pounds against the windows of Doctor Bellamy’s office. Doctor Bellamy sits at his desk, sorting through files and shifting stacks of paper from left to right. Shannon Ulger sits across from Bellamy, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you should go forward with the kid,” Ulger says.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>“I know, Shannon,” says the doc. “You’ve said. A few times now.”</p>
<p>“But you’re going ahead with it. With everything. This–”</p>
<p>“I know what I’m doing, Shannon. Do you think you were much better off when we found you?”</p>
<p>“No, but it’s different. There’s something different about this kid, Doc. I’m telling you. Something’s not right.”</p>
<p>“I know, Shannon. You keep telling me. But remember, we went through the same thing with you, back when we–”</p>
<p>“No. It isn’t the same. It’s something <em>else.</em> He’s like me, yes. But he’s different too. There’s something wrong with him. There’s something <em>extra</em> running around inside his head.</p>
<p>The door to Bellamy’s office crashes open. Enter DURWARD and ZITA.</p>
<p>Doctor Durward has a stern, stony look on her face.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to get you on the phone,” she says.</p>
<p>Bellamy pushes a stack of papers out of the way so he can see his phone: an old desktop rotary-dialer. He takes the handset off the cradle and puts it to his ear. He pushes the hang-up toggle a few times.</p>
<p>“The line’s dead,” he says.</p>
<p>“Convenient,” says Durward. “This is Louis Blake’s Aunt, Millicent Zita. She’s here to … collect her nephew.”</p>
<p>Bellamy returns the phone to its cradle. “I wasn’t aware of any living relatives,” he says.</p>
<p>“I do not care what you were or were not previously aware of. You are aware of it now.”</p>
<p>“Nope. Here it is.” Bellamy pulls Louis’ file from one of the stacks on his desk and examines its contents. “No next of kin. See? He’s an orphan. a Ward of the State.”</p>
<p>Durward steps forward, gliding across the floor until she looms over Bellamy’s paper-strewn desk. The crisp lines of her suit are a stark contrast to the chaos and the blurred boundaries of Bellamy’s world, where one stack of papers bleeds into the next without rhythm or reason. “Are you referring to the paperwork and ignoring ‘the reality that stands before your eyes’? How very … unusual of you.”</p>
<p>Millicent Zita looks uncomfortable. She says “I’ll just wait in the other room.” She backs out of Bellamy’s office, into the adjacent library.</p>
<p>Shannon slips out of the room after her. He does not lift his eyes from the floor. His shoulders are hunched.</p>
<p>BELLAMY:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is she? We can’t release a patient into her care. She has no claim. This is ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DURWARD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She has every claim. She is family. And … don’t … ever question me … again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BELLAMY:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kid needs help. No one else can help him like we can. It was a miracle he fell into our hands. You can’t just send him away. He’s doomed out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DURWARD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is Louis Blake?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Louis Blake is in the dark.</p>
<p>He doesn’t see the light for days. He clutches his knees to his chest and he rocks back and forth.</p>
<p>The voice inside him isn’t a voice. It is a sound. It is a texture. It is desire. It slowly builds and threatens to overwhelm him. It manifests in fits of giggling. He sits in the dark, scratching at his skin until it bleeds and he clutches his knees to his raw and bloodied chest and he collapses into fits of terrible giggling.</p>
<p>Nothing is funny. He knows this. He doesn’t laugh out of humor. He doesn’t really laugh at all. He convulses. He shakes and he retches, but it all comes out as laughter. He doesn’t laugh, he tells himself, but he knows that he does.</p>
<p>Louis dreams. His dreams are of the open road. He dreams of dirt and grass and of gravel. He dreams of running. Of feeling the spongy turf push back against his toes–of feeling it flex and accept his weight and resist and return like a spring, flinging him up and out into the night.</p>
<p>His strides stretch out longer and longer. He covers great expanses of land as he flies through the night.</p>
<p>He is naked in his dreams.</p>
<p>He chases the setting sun.</p>
<p>He is sure that he might catch it, just over the next rise, so he runs faster, he flies farther. But the sun stays beyond his reach.</p>
<p>You can’t catch the sun, he tells himself.</p>
<p>But he tries.</p>
<p>He wakes up in a twisted knot on the floor, drenched in cold sweat. The straight jacket is gone. The floor is cold, but there are wool blankets tangled at his feet. He wipes himself with them. They stink. The wool scratches him, scraping the scabs away from his raw chest. The bleeding starts again. The stinking wool stings.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he says into the emptiness.</p>
<p>Louis resists the surging, gag-like waves of muscle contractions rising up from his guts. He feels nauseous.</p>
<p>A low panel in the door slides open with a clang.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Louis calls again. His voice is a quavering, broken croak.</p>
<p>Large black-gloved hands shove something through the opening in the door.</p>
<p>The panel slams shut and a deadbolt drops into place. A puppy, small, black and frightened, whimpers.</p>
<p>Louis reaches toward it.</p>
<p>The puppy backs away, its tail tucked between its legs. It shakes and cries and pees on its feet.</p>
<p>Louis gags and convulses and coughs out a chortle. He clamps his hands over his mouth, tries to cover it, but the fingers find their way inside and he digs at his gums and pulls at his cheeks and he gnaws at his fingers and he laughs and howls and laughs.</p>

<!-- PLOT: Louis has a showdown with Shannon Ulger -->
<!-- PLOT: Louis and Shannon go out of their heads.  Like two territorial creatures forced into a too-small cage -->
