## episode one: quid pro quo

### 01 - Intro

<!-- ACT ONE: Daisy, Tank & Louis enter into a medical trailer, seeking a calm space. Louis is suffering from the onset of a panic attack. (he's seen something that set him off) -->

<!-- ACT ONE: Daisy rummages through drawers and cabinets while Tank calls for a ride – they need to be picked up now. The person on the other end of the phone: You took him where? Are you crazy? Louis is dangerous. -->

"Give him some space," Tank said. "He needs some space. Let him breathe."

Louis was pudgy, pale and hyperventilating, seated in a padded leatherette examination chair with a chrome footrest.

Daisy wiped his face with a wad of wet paper towels, leaving little pills of paper stuck to him.

Tank pushed her roughly aside, sending her caroming off the cabinetry. "I told you to give him some space," Tank said. "He needs to breathe."

"Fuck you, Tank," Daisy said, wiping blood from the corner of her mouth. "It was helping. And you fucking ... I bit my fucking tongue. Asshole."

Tank pressed his fingers to Louis' wrist. His cell phone was wedged between his shoulder and his ear as he watched the second hand of the clock on the wall.

"This is Tank Halloran," he said. "I'm going to need a--What? Yes, I'll hold. ... Fucking bitch! I lost count. What? No. Not you. You put me on hold. I didn't know you were still on the line. I need a--yes, I'll hold. Dammit, Daisy. Daisy, get away from there! Get out of the cupboard. Yes, thank you. I have a patient with--my name is Tank Halloran, Attendant Ward. Yes. No. No, I have two patients ... on a field trip, right, but I need a car to pick us up right away. Louis Blake is having an episode ... a panic attack."

### 02 – Complication / Conceit 

<!-- ACT TWO: Daisy gets upset – they can't go back yet. Tank promised he'd take her to the funhouse. They made a 
deal. Quid pro Quo. Despite Louis' nervous situation, he remains relatively calm, while those around him become more and more agitated.  -->

"No!" Daisy said. "We can't leave!" She lunged at Tank, and pulled his cell phone away from him. She threw it across the medical trailer. "Not until we see the funhouse. You promised, Tank. You promised."

Daisy's mascara was running. She stood facing Tank with her shoulders hunched, her hands balled up into little fists at her sides.

"Wait, just relax," Louis said, gulping down air. "Hang on a minute. Just relax. Lets just relax and stay here for a minute."

"No," Daisy said. "We have to get back out there. I don't want to be in this stupid hospital truck. We have to go to the funhouse. Tank, you promised. I put it in my mouth and you promised we could go to the funhouse."

"Daisy, hush," Tank said. "We don't talk about that. Remember? I'll make it up to you. I'll take you to the funhouse, but right now, we've got to take care of Louis. Okay?"

Daisy took a step toward Tank and reached toward his belt buckle. "Do you want me to do it again? I'll do it right now. Okay?"

<!-- ACT TWO: Louis doesn't want to go out there, because he saw something. Something about his teacher, something that started him having these panic episodes in the first place. He doesn't want to have another episode, and if he goes out there, he's going to have another episode. You don't want me to have another episode ... -->

"Guys, stop," Louis said. His voice was small and unsteady. "Just calm down, okay? I am not freaking out. Everything's fine. I just need to catch my breath, okay?." 

His breath came ragged and hard. It wracked his whole body. His knuckles popped and went white with the strain of clutching the examination chair armrests. Sweat dripped down his face.

"Stop that, Daisy," Tank said. "Louis doesn't look so good."

"I'll be okay. I just. I ... I can't catch my breath."

"What happened, Louis?" Tank pushed Daisy away and stepped toward Louis. "You were doing so well. Just relax. Breathe, Louis. That's it. Nice and easy."

"Why did we have to bring stupid Louis along?" Daisy said. 

"I couldn't bring you by yourself, Daisy." Tank said. "All alone? But look, I'll make it up to you. Right now we've got to take care of Louis. Okay? How you doing, Louis? You feeling better?"

"I'll be okay," Louis said, clutching at his chest with a pained look on his face. "It's getting dark," he said. His voice quavered, barely more than a whisper. "It's a full moon tonight, isn't it?" 

"He looks blue," Tank said. "We better get him home, I think."

"No! We're going to the funhouse! I hate Louis. I hate you, Louis. This is all your fault. Louis has Lupus. That's what's wrong with him. He doesn't belong with us. And he's stupid. Why did we have to bring him, anyway? You promised, Tank. You promised."

"Daisy, get a grip," Tank said. "I'll make it up to you. But we're not going to see the funhouse today. Okay?"


### 03 – Climax / Turning Point 	

<!-- ACT THREE: Daisy escalates. She is adamant about the funhouse. She finds a syringe and injects Tank with it. She tries to run out, but Tank grabs her and wrestles her to the ground. He reacts violently, and accidentally smacks her one in the face. -->

She stared back at him. Neither of them spoke. 

Louis' breath was loud, ragged and desperate. It competed with the sounds of the fair outside the trailer. Indiscernible melodies played on a distant fiddle. The clang of bells cut through the buzz of machinery and amplified voices. 

Daisy was the first to look away. She broke eye contact and crossed her arms under her breasts and she walked into the corner of the trailer, where she could look out the window. "You promised you'd take me to the funhouse," she said, barely loud enough to be heard.

Tank ignored her mutterings and crossed to the opposite corner to pick his phone off the floor.

Daisy started to rummage through the cabinets while Tank shouted into his phone, "Hello! Can you hear me? Hello? The damn thing is broken. Great, Daisy. If you broke my phone, you stupid fucking bitch, I'll--"

Daisy ripped the plastic away from a single-use syringe and lifted it over her head. She screamed and charged at Tank, taking him by surprise as she sank the needle into the flesh where the top of his shoulder met his neck.

"Holy fuck," Tank dropped his phone and wrapped his arms around Daisy, pinning her arms to her sides. He lifted her up into the air and slammed her into the cabinets. They fell together into a tangled heap on the floor.

<!-- ACT THREE: Tank: You know how fucking dangerous that is? What the fuck did you hit me with? He's sweating and a little nauseous and really pumped up. Epinephrine. Adrenaline. Are you stupid? -->

"Stop," Louis said, without moving from the examination chair. "If you don't calm down, there's no telling ..." 

"You trying to kill me, you bitch?" Tank said. "Just what the fuck do you think you are doing?" He pressed her down onto the linoleum-covered floor. He held her wrists together with one hand and pinned them above her head. With his other hand, he pulled the syringe from his shoulder and looked at it. "Epinephrine. Adrenaline. Are you fucking stupid?"

<!-- ACT THREE: EMTs come in (it's their trailer): What the hell is going on here? Tank's got Daisy pinned in a compromising position. She shouts “Rape!” -->

The strawberry light of sunset shot into the trailer as two EMTs burst through the door. 

"Is everything all right?"

"Rape!" Daisy shouted. "Get him off of me." She began to sob.

### 04 – Falling Action / Suspense / Reversal / Spiral / Escalation	

<!-- ACT FOUR: the EMTs struggle with Tank, trying to pull him off of Daisy -->

"Tank?" One of the EMTs said. "I think you'd better get off of her. You said the kid needed a minute to catch his breath."

"Hey, Bradley ... what's that smell?" the other EMT said. "This guy's your friend? Is that sulfur? You'd better get him offa her. Jesus Christ, man."

"Nah, that's like ... matches. Magnesium or sump'n. Sulfur smells like old eggs and shit. And I know him ... but he ain't my friend. I didn't know he was *this* kinda freaky. Get up offa her, Tank. Just like Jared said. Nice and slow."

"I am going to need another minute here, boys," Tank said.

"Yeah? You need another minute? Well, you ain't going to get it, you sick son of a bitch. Get the fuck offa her."

Louis wheezed. His eyes were wide--yellowed whites gleamed all around them. "It's gonna be fine," he said. "Just everybody calm down, okay?"

"Mind your business, yeah?" Tank said. "You 

<!-- TODO: pickup edit here -->

The EMTs lunged at Tank. "Grab his arm, Bradley. Ow! Fuck. Fucking hold him."

"What the fuck is wrong with you guys? She's my patient. Goddamn it. She's unstable. She needs to be restrained right now, not me. She stabbed me with a fucking Epi-Pen."

---

The EMTs Bradley and Jared struggled with Tank. They Pulled him off of Daisy and stumbled around, knocking into things. 
What things? This might be a good moment to get a better visual sense of the trailer.
"Get off of me, you fucking *technicians,*" Tank said. He spit the word 'technicians' with such venom there was no mistaking his disgust. "What, did you order your certifications online? I am a fucking *NURSE.* Respect your betters."

"Where did you say you work?" EMT Jared said as Tank smashed him into the countertop.

"Seven Oaks," Tank said, struggling to speak as EMT Bradley's fingers gouged into his eyes and face.

"Up at the assylum, huh?" EMT Bradley said.

"Just bringing these two out for a day trip."

"Day's about done, son. You better relax."
I like this diolouge, but to be honest, I have a hard time believing that it can happen as the EMT is getting the wind knocked out of him.
<!-- ACT FOUR: While Tank is talking with the EMTs, Daisy messes with Louis, pressing her tits in his face, teasing him, alternating between encouraging him and berating him—trying to convince him to freak out, or to take her to the fun house -->

Daisy kicked off from the cabinets and slid across the linoleum floor to the base of Louis' examination chair. She reached for Louis' hand, but Louis jerked it away as soon as she touched it. 
Can you make it a little clearer that this is happening in the middle of a fight that's taking place in a tiny room?
He sat with his eyes pressed tightly together, counting under his breath, which was still ragged and gasping.

Daisy pulled herself up via the armrest instead. She pressed her breasts to Louis's legs, sliding them up his body as she lifted herself into a kneeling position in front of him.

"I've always liked you, Louis," she said.

Louis didn't open his eyes. His mouth kept working, pushing numbers out his trembling lips as he shook his head back and forth.

"Are you serious?" Tank shouted from across the room. Bradley and Jared, EMTs struggled to hold him down. "Get the fuck off of him, Daisy. I told you. He needs space." 

"What's the matter, Tank? You jealous?" Daisy pushed her way closer to Louis, so she stood with her legs to either side of his knee. "You know ... we could slip out of here," she said. "We don't need them. We can go to the funhouse ourselves. Just you and me, Louis ... alone together. It could be *real* fun. Come on."

Louis gagged. He choked and sputtered and fell from the chair.

"Oh fuck," Daisy said. "You threw up on my shoe. He threw up on my shoe!"

"What's happening to me?" Louis spasmed and heaved and coughed up fluid that splashed on the linoleum floor.
I'm a little confused here. Has this happened to Louis before? There's times in this scene where he seems to be scared of something that he knows will happen, then here he is unsure. Which one is it?
"Oh gross," Daisy said.

"Is that blood?" EMT Bradley said, loosening his grip on Tank's arm.

"Jesus," EMT Jared said. "He really doesn't look so good."

Taking advantage of their distraction, Tank pulled his right arm free and smashed it into EMT Jared's face. "No shit?" Tank said. "Is that your professional opinion?" 

Jared crashed limp to the floor. 

Bradley caught Tank's free swinging arm. He hooked a hand around his bicep and pulled, trying to keep him from hitting Jared again. He was surprised to meet with no resistance and terrified to discover Tank's elbow accelerating toward him.

Tank's elbow exploded into Bradley's throat.

Bradley went stiff and staggered backward, clutching at his throat and sputtering a froth of saliva.

### 05 – Catastrophe / conclusion / resolution / denouement		

<!-- ACT FIVE: Louis has had it. His temper flares. His vision goes red. “Oh shit, here it comes.” Louis blacks out and PEOPLE GET HURT. -->

Tank cracked his neck and picked up his telephone. "Alright kids," he said. "This field trip is over. Oh for fuck's sake. GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, LOUIS!"

"Louis ... What is wrong with your eyes?" Daisy said. "Louis ... I didn't mean anything by it. Are you okay? We don't have to go ... I can ... I mean ... forget the funhouse."

Tank mashed at the butons on his phone. The screen was cracked and distorted, but it made a series of musical chimes as it came to life in his hands. As soon as it powered on, it began to ring.

<!-- TODO: what's Tank's ringtone? -->

He answered it. "This is Tank Halloran. Yes. I did call--Yes, I still need a car! What the fuck? Where is the fucking car? My patient is freaking out and--a panic attack. A fucking panic attack, and these assholes here have made things so much worse--Yes. I've just been attacked by these--Who is it? The patient is Louis Blake, and--yes, I'll hold."

"I can smell it," Louis said, his voice gutteral and raspy. Where it had been soft and unsteady, it was now scraping and booming, like a wheelbarrow full of stones being dumped into a mine shaft.
While this is a fun and discriptive metaphore, I would love to hear you use one that relates to Louis' state of mind, the funhouse, or the bloody scene in the room.
"What? What are you talking about?" Daisy backed away from Louis without getting up. She fell back onto her ass and shuffled away, pushing with her hands and feet until she backed into the cabinets.

<!-- NOTE: I thought it might be nice to add something about how Tank isn't supposed to have Daisy off the grounds ... she either isn't cleared for this kind of thing, or has a reputation of being a manipulator of a perhaps sexual nature - perhaps neither of these patients should be cleared for day trips. Perhaps Tank is only a janitor -->

<!-- NOTE: does the ending need something different? I kind of want the transformation to be vague at this point, but ideally it should be conclusive somehow. or cliffhangy? -->

Louis seemed to fill the medical trailer. Though he didn't appear to physically change (to grow from one moment to the next) his presence expanded. 

His breath had deepened and evened out. It was loud. The loudest thing in the trailer. The only other sound was the voice coming through Tank's cellular phone.

"Who gave you authorization to take him off the property? Jesus Christ, Halloran. The car is on the way, but do you have any idea how much trouble you are causing? They've been looking everywhere for this kid. Hello? Halloran? Tank? Are you there?"

Louis didn't look pudgy or asthmatic. His eyes glowed deep yellow. Tusks of blood and bile hung from his mouth. His body seemed to pulse and bristle with energy. He filled half the trailer with his physical presence. He was all darkness, sinew and muscle. 
Love the "tusks of blood."
Louis leapt.

There was a sound like the roar of an animal or an explosion. A wave of hot air blasted through the confined space, smelling of burning match-heads. All the lightbulbs exploded, sending the trailer into darkness.
I'm not sure that something can sound like the "roar of an animal or and explosion." Could sould halfway between the two, could sould like "the roar of an animal or the shredding of lumber" not sure. Just didn't sit quite right for me.
Daisy screamed. 

The trailer rocked back and forth on its blocks and fell over.

The sound of tearing flesh and breaking bones soon overtook and replaced the screams.
