## PANIC attacks episode 04

<!-- PLOT: On the way through the building, Louis encounters another patient, Shannon Ulger, who recognizes some sort of kinship. -->

Louis sat in the garden. 

He was glad to be at Seven Oaks, but he couldn't remember how he got there, where his clothes were, or what day it was. 

Lately, this sort of thing had been happening to Louis, and he didn't like it. 

He didn't like being out in public without any clothes on, either. But it was worse, he thought, to go through the jarring shock of finding himself in a new place, at a new time, without proper narrative context. 

<!--more-->

He tried to retrace his footsteps and think back over his day--or, the previous night, rather, for the sun was just now rising above the crest of the East Wing--but he came up with nothing.

Louis had never been particularly fond of retracing his steps, but as soon as he lost the ability to do so, he recognized it as a much more important activity than he had previously suspected.

---

He hoped someone would come along soon, for it was a bit chilly out in the garden. But at the same time, he hoped no one would come along at all, not ever, for the naked body is an extremely private thing, he thought. Especially his own. Maybe he would feel different about the naked body if his own wasn't so pudgy and pale and awkward, and if he wasn't prone to break out in the nasty red 'butterfly' rashes.

Louis had a hard time dealing with his embarrassment. He wasn't used to crowds or strangers or to people in general. He was used to cheap hotel rooms with the blinds drawn. He was used to his mother coming in late from her long days of work or research, from her long days of hunting. She didn't hunt for meat, she hunted for information. She hunted for health. For Louis' health. She hunted hospitals and pharmacies and alternative healing clinics. She hunted for a cure. She hunted for something to stabilize him, for an ongoing treatment to make a 'normal' life possible.

Often she came "home" tired, depressed and disillusioned, her hope worn thin and stretched to the limit. But sometimes she came home excited and manic. Ecstatic, even. When she had a new lead, a new treatment to try, an experimental drug or therapy, she was alive, full of energy. They had direction. A new destination. A city on the other seaboard, perhaps. Or a mountain retreat somewhere in California. A holistic healing center in the hills outside Sacramento. A hot springs in Arkansas with naturally-occurring lithium in the water. A shaman on the Texas-Mexico border ...

And they were off like a rocket. Hotel room emptied out, packed into the little white Ford Fiesta, and on the road by five the next morning, watching the sun rise over the open highway.

But that was over. 

Louis sat in the garden, worrying about his nakedness. That was enough. He didn't want to think about how he'd come to be here. He didn't want to think about what had happened since he and his mother had set out to meet the shaman on the Texas-Mexico border.

He hoped someone would come along soon and bring him a blanket or a coat. Even one of the hospital gowns would be fine. But he also hoped no one would ever find him. As long as he sat here, waiting, his nakedness and his aloneness were the only things wrong in the world. That and the chill. And he'd eventually get hungry. Yes, he'd have to eat sooner or later too.

But as long as he sat here alone, he didn't have to think about any of that. There was no one to worry over him. No one to hound him with those dreaded questions, 'how are you feeling?' or 'where are your clothes?' or 'what happened last night?' 

Something bad happened last night.

Every time he experienced one of these disorienting time-space lapses, something bad happened. 

But it was better not to think of such things. As long as he sat here in the garden, worrying about who might find him, and what they might think, he wouldn't have to think about what might have happened while he was away.

---

<!-- PLOT: It is not another dark place, but the same, Ulger says. "You have a window inside you. I have a window too. They are different windows, but they look out onto the same space, onto the same darkness. But ... you don't even know who you are." -->

A stirring in the hydrangeas caught Louis' ear.

"Who's there?" he asked, hoping there would be no answer.

An old man in a blue-white bathrobe stepped out of the mophead brush and sat next to Louis on the bench. He crossed his legs and looked Louis in the eye.

The man wasn't wearing pants or shoes. In fact, he appeared to be naked beneath his bathrobe. The robe was damp and dirty. There were pine needles and other bits of woodland detritus sticking to it here and there. 

"Good morning," Louis said.

"Is that a \**cough--hack*\* --?" the old man said, his voice catching in his throat. "Excuse me. Hairball. Is that a question?"

Louis blinked at the old man.

"I stayed up to watch the moon set," The old man said. "Did you catch it? She went down right over there." He pointed across the valley to the open west. His voice was gravelly, guttural and somehow ... lonely. "Beautiful things ... are often better when shared. If  you are ... if you are going to be staying here for a while," he gestured back toward the east wing.

Louis shied away from the old man. This was the last thing he needed. He was being accosted by a pervert. 

"You might want to steal a bathrobe or two, and hide them out in the woods," the old man said.

Louis looked around nervously, hoping to see a doctor or one of the wards.

The old man followed Louis' gaze to a flowering vine that clung to the brick of the main building. "Ah, yes. The Moonlight Schizophragma. Quite lovely, no? In the moonlight, her flowers were divine! When I first checked myself in--I was doing a lot of cocaine back then--my ex ... she brought be a little ... I don't know if bouquet is the right word for it, exactly ... a bundle, maybe ... of moonlight flowers. She was a botanist or a horticulturist ... I never could figure the difference, you know? But that was her idea of a big joke. Schizo - phragma. I guess it's Latin for 'split septum.' Here. Look at this."

The old man leaned in close over Louis, who was looking everywhere but at the old man. The old man pulled his nose open with one thumb in each nostril, trying to position himself in Louis' line of sight. "I've got a perforated septum," he said. "It doesn't bother me any more. But it'll never heal. Did you ever see anything like that?"

Louis scrambled to the far end of the bench, shying away and making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible.   

"Don't worry, it won't happen to you," the old man said. "Not if you stay away from the cocaine, anyhow. You don't really look like the railing type, little man. You know what it's like ... to stare into the mirror?" 

"No," Louis said. He could feel the blood rushing into his face, pounding in his ears. 

"We see the same thing when we stare into the mirror, you and I. You think you are looking at yourself, but it's not you. Not only you. Not only me and not only you, little man. It's more. So much more." The old man inhaled deeply through his nose. "You are frightened ... to look into the mirror. You've hidden it away. You can't hide it away forever, boy!"

"Get away from him, Mister Ulger!"

Louis was relieved to hear Doctor Bellamy's voice calling across the garden. He would have preferred if the facility director, Doctor Durward, had showed up ... she made him feel much safer than Bellamy did ... but he was relieved to hear the voice of anyone at all. Especially an authority figure that was likely to hold sway over this strange old man.

"Listen, boy--" the old man said.

"I said leave him alone, Shannon" Doctor Bellamy wrapped a blanket around Louis shoulders and sent away the strange old man named Shannon Ulger.

<!-- PLOT: Bellamy pushes Louis to open up. Louis refuses. He doesn't want to talk about anything. -->

Doctor Bellamy gave Louis a hospital gown and sat him down across from his oversized desk. "The police are going to want to speak with you," Bellamy said.

"I'm fine," Louis said. "Thanks for asking."

"Are you?" the Doctor said. "Are you *really* ... fine?"

Louis was uncomfortable. He was embarrassed and this whole thing was awkward. It was beyond awkward. He didn't know how to admit it, but he was frightened too. No. He musn't allow his thoughts to go there. He mustn't acknowledge the fear and worry and the pain. His mother had taught him to push down those feelings, to lock them away in the cave in the woods inside his mind.

It was better if he focused on something small, something in front of him now. His feet were cold. He was embarrassed to have been found in the garden without any clothes on. 

"I'm fine," Louis said again.

"What does that mean, Louis? Maybe you could describe to me ... what it feels like. To be ... fine."

"My feet are cold, I guess. I wish I had some proper clothes."

"We were all very worried about you, Louis. You know ... it's quite all right for you to be upset. It's quite normal, really. You've been through a lot, you know. It often does a lot of good to ... you know ... express yourself. You are safe here. I know you are still getting used to it, Louis, but ... I want you to know that it is okay to talk about your feelings. Even if they aren't what you normally think of as 'good' feelings. At this point, where you are ... all feelings are good, Louis. It's perfectly natural to feel sad or angry or guilty ... or even joy, or a sense of freedom. It's normal to experience these ... positive ... kinds of feelings to. You don't have to feel guilty for them. Are you happy, Louis?"

"No." Louis said. 

Louis didn't want to be inside any more. He didn't want to express himself. He wanted to wall off that dark place inside him that echoed with emotion. He'd been taught his whole life to shut out anything that made him feel. It was dangerous for him to feel.
