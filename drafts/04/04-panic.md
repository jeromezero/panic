## PANIC attacks episode 04

### 01 - Intro

<!-- pre-existing conflict  / exposition -->

<!-- ACT ONE: On the way through the building, Louis encounters another patient, Shannon Ulger, who recognizes some sort of kinship. -->

Louis sat in the garden. 

He was glad to be at Seven Oaks, but he couldn't remember how he got there, where his clothes were, or what day it was. 

Lately, this sort of thing had been happening to Louis, and he didn't like it. 

He didn't like being out in public without any clothes on, either. But it was worse, he thought, to go through the jarring shock of finding himself in a new place, at a new time, without proper narrative context. 

<!--more-->

He tried to retrace his footsteps and think back over his day--or, the previous night, rather, for the sun was just now rising above the crest of the East Wing--but he came up with nothing.

Louis had never been particularly fond of retracing his steps, but as soon as he lost the ability to do so, he recognized it as a much more important activity than he had previously suspected.

---

He hoped someone would come along soon, for it was a bit chilly out in the garden. But at the same time, he hoped no one would come along at all, not ever, for the naked body is an extremely private thing, he thought. Especially his own. Maybe he would feel different about the naked body if his own wasn't so pudgy and pale and awkward, and if he wasn't prone to break out in the nasty red 'butterfly' rashes.

Louis had a hard time dealing with his embarassment. He wasn't used to crowds or strangers or to people in general. He was used to cheap hotel rooms with the blinds drawn. He was used to his mother coming in late from her long days of work or research, from her long days of hunting. She didn't hunt for meat, she hunted for information. She hunted for health. For Louis' health. She hunted hospitals and pharmacies and alternative healing clinics. She hunted for a cure. She hunted for something to stabilize him, for an ongoing treatment to make a 'normal' life possible.

Often she came "home" tired, depressed and disillusioned, her hope worn thin and stretched to the limit. But sometimes she came home excited and manic. Ecstatic, even. When she had a new lead, a new treatment to try, an experimental drug or therapy, she was alive, full of energy. They had direction. A new destination, perhaps. A city on the other seaboard. A mountain retreat. A holistic healing center in the hills outside Sacramento. A hot springs in Arkansas with unprecedented healing minerals. A shaman on the Texas-Mexico border ...

And they were off like a rocket. Hotel room emptied out, packed into the little white Ford Fiesta, and on the road by six the next morning, watching the sun rise over the open highway.

But that was over. 

As long as Louis sat in the garden, worrying about his nakedness, everything would be fine. That problem was big enough. He wouldn't have to think about how he'd come to be here. He wouldn't have to think about what had happened since he and his mother had set out to meet the shaman on the Texas-Mexico border.

He hoped someone would come along soon and bring him a blanket or a coat. Even one of the hospital gowns would be fine. But he hoped no one would come along at all. He didn't want to move on to the next logical step. 

Every time he experienced one of these disorienting time-space lapses, something terrible happened. 

But it was better not to think of such things. As long as he sat here in the garden, worrying about who might find him, and what they might think, he wouldn't have to think about what might have happened while he was away.

---

<!-- When someone draped a blanket over him, Louis hoped it was Doctor Durward. She was a woman, but her gender didn't seem to matter. It wasn't that Lois would rather be seen naked by a woman--no, that was a terrifying thought--but Doctor Durward seemed to be beyond sex and gender. She was distant and cool, but kind and protective. Something about her made Louis feel safe and welcome and cared for.  -->

<!-- But as Louis pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, he saw that it was the other doctor. Doctor Bellamy. The stern and judgmental doctor. -->

<!-- Louis looked up, and Doctor Bellamy was standing with his arms folded across his chest, staring down at Louis, a stern and judgmental look on his face. -->

<!-- ACT ONE: It is not another dark place, but the same, Ulger says. "You have a window inside you. I have a window too. They are different windows, but they look out onto the same space, onto the same darkness. But ... you don't even know who you are." -->

A stirring in the hydrangas caught Louis' ear.

"Who's there?" he asked, hoping there would be no answer.

An old man in a blue-white bathrobe stepped out onto the path and sat next to Louis on the bench. He crossed his legs and looked Louis in the eye.

The man wasn't wearing pants or shoes. In fact, he appeared to be naked beneath his bathrobe.

"Lovely morning," Louis said.

"Is that a \**cough--hack*\* --?" the old man said, his voice catching in his throat. "Excuse me. Hairball. Is that a question?"

Louis blinked at the old man.

"I stayed up to watch the moon set," The old man said. "Did you catch it? She went down right over there." He pointed across the valley to the open west. 

Seven Oaks was laid out like a horseshoe. The main building to the North, the East wing to the east, and to the south, down the slope, the maximum security Secret Black Wing.

Louis shrugged. He didn't remember it one way or the other. This was the last thing he needed. A pervert stumbling around in the garden. He was cornered. He began to look around, nervously, hoping to see a doctor or one of the wards.

"You nervous, little man?" the old man said. "Don't worry. I've seen it all before. Am I making you ... uncomfortable?"

Yes! He was making Louis terribly uncomfortable. "No," Louis said. "It's just ... I'm a little ..." Louis could feel the blood rushing into his face, pounding in his ears. 

"You aren't used to it yet," the old man said. His voice was gravelly and gutteral, but it somehow reminded Louis of a winsome country ballad. It was ... lonely. "You aren't used to it yet, but you'll get the hang of it, kid. There's tricks ... techniques ... little things you can do. Maybe, if you're going to be living here," he gestured back toward the east wing.

Oh no! This is it, Louis thought. He's propositioning me. Isn't he? He's going to make me his little bitch? I've seen things like this ... on TV ... in the movies.

"You might want to steal a bathrobe or two, and hide them out in the woods."

The old man's bathrobe looked rather damp and dirty. There were pine needles and other bits of woodland detritus sticking to it here and there.

"Relax, little fella," the man said, putting his hand--in what he must have thought was a reassuring manner--on Louis' knee. "I'm not gonna bite you. I just ... I'm happy to see you out here."

"I'm sure you are."

"I've been alone for a long time. And you ... you are so young. You don't know what it's like yet, to truly be alone ... but ... You aren't the only one. I can see it when I look at you. You can see it too. Look at me."

Louis was looking everywhere but at the old man. He didn't want to get up and show him his goodies. He didn't want to sprint for cover ... but maybe he should.

"Look at me, little man."

Louis looked at the old man.

"You can see it in me too. Even if you don't realize it. I have it too, little Lupo. I have it too."

"Oh yeah? You have it too? That's nice." Louis had no idea what the old man was talking about.

"That dark window inside of you. I have it too. The same. Well ... the window is different ... but it looks out onto the same place, little man. It looks out onto the same darkness. We are brothers, you and I ... but .... You don't know it, do you? You haven't even looked ... you don't know who you are. My boy--"

"Get away from him, Shannon!"

Louis was relieved to hear Doctor Bellamy's voice calling across the garden. He would have preferred if the facility director, Doctor Durward, had showed up ... she made him feel much safer than Bellamy did ... but he was relieved to hear the voice of anyone at all. Especially an authority figure that was likely to hold sway over this strange old man.

"Listen, boy--" the old man said.

"I said leave him alone," Doctor Bellamy wrapped a blanket around Louis shoulders and sent away the strange old man named Shannon.


<!-- ACT TWO Bellamy pushes Louis to open up. Louis refuses. He doesn't want to talk about anything. -->

Doctor Bellamy gave Louis a 

### 02 – Complication / Conceit 

<!-- encounter pre-existing conflict - Crossing The First Threshold -->

<!-- ACT TWO:  Bellamy: "If you can master yourself, you will find comfort here." (an interdiction to be violated) -->

<!-- ACT TWO: Doctor Bellamy: "The path has to be walked every day, Louis. If you want to get better, you need to apply yourself. This is no easy thing here. You can't rely on your mother's teat any longer. If you don't set some goals and work toward them, your life here will be miserable. -->

<!-- ACT TWO: you are different, special. this is a place for people like you. you will be safe here. our residents will welcome you. Louis lets his guard down.
-->


### 03 – Climax / Turning Point 	

<!-- Approach the Inmost Cave -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Bellamy pushes Louis closer to the darkness within him. Closer than he wants to go. He bullies him toward it. When Louis approaches it, there is something different about it. Something unusual and frightening. He hears a voice whispering in the darkness - he can't make out the words, but he hears cries of rage and anguish. Claws scratching at the door. -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Long ago, Louis boarded up the dark place in the woods of his mind. A cave ... He boarded it up, sealed it and let the path get overgrown. Bellamy pushes Louis on a guided meditation. They walk down the path together, clearing away the brush that has grown over it. Louis is reminded of his flight through the woods, his flight from the terrible ordeal in which he lost his mother. -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Louis is disturbed, frightened. Wants to stop. Bellamy pushes him onward. They arrive at the cave, and the boards have been broken. The bricks he carefully laid have been knocked in. -->

<!-- ACT THREE: This is good, Bellamy says. "You can't keep your inner life locked away. You must confront it. It may be difficult, especially if you do not feel ready, but you must confront it." But no ... nothing broke *out* of the cave. Something forced its way *in*. Louis can hear it down there ... growling in pain and anger. -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Louis turns away in fear. He breaks from the meditation. "I can't ..." he says. -->


### 04 – Falling Action / Suspense / Reversal / Spiral / Escalation		

<!-- Reward	- The Ultimate Boon -->

<!-- ACT FOUR: Back in the dorms, Louis is not welcomed. Other patients or 'guests' rattle their doors, smash their plates and scream at Louis. They sense something inside him. Something lurking inside of Louis' dark place. Shannon Ulger is to be Louis' roommate, but he rails against Louis. At first he is hopeful. They have something in common. "I don't meet many of our kind," he says. But ... "There is something in you ... something terrible," he says. "Get it away. Get away." He attacks Louis, who fears for his life. He is being beaten to a pulp when the wards come into the room and stop the fight. they haul Louis away and lock him in solitary confinement.  -->


###05 – Catastrophe / conclusion / resolution / denouement

<!-- Resurrection - Master of Two Worlds -->

<!-- ACT FIVE:  Louis: Why am I locked up? Why am I being punished? I was attacked without reason ... Bellamy: Louis ... You had better pray that Shannon survives. You nearly killed him. If you don't get a hold of your rage ... if you don't apply yourself, there is little we can do for you here. -->
