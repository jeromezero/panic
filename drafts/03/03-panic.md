## The Dark Mirror of the Soul

<!-- pre-existing conflict  / exposition -->

<!-- ACT ONE: Louis' relationship to the dark place inside of him. louis supresses a wash of emotion and sensation that flows out of the dark place, threatening to overwhelm him - tricks his mother taught him -->

<!-- TODO: tie this flashback to a current emotional disturbance - Louis is trying to find his way back from the fairgrounds incident. Talking himself down as he aproaches the relatively safe haven of the asylum -->

Louis hated the way his mother described that dark, chaotic place inside of him, that darkness into which he could not look. She called it *the Dark Mirror of the Soul.*

She said it was like a mirror because it reflected back whatever Louis was feeling. It was dark because what it reflected was changed, the details became all muddled.

She was sort of right, but she was sort of wrong too. She didn't know. Not really. She said Louis' father had it too, the dark place, but Louis' father had been gone for a long time. 

<!--more-->

Louis couldn't remember his father, not really. Not more than a vague impression of a comforting combination of wiry hair, bristling beard and salted stubble. 

Louis couldn't explain to his mother how it was different from what she said. That was the main thing about the dark place inside of him: words disappeared there. If it had a truth, it was a truth beyond language.

It didn't feel like a mirror when he approached it. It felt like a sunset, like an open cellar door. If he stood in front of the dark place inside of him, he could feel something washing over him in waves. He couldn't explain what washed over him. It was different all the time, depending on what he was feeling. It was like the light of the sun on his face, the bite of freezing wind. It was like the smell of banana bread, of rotting fish. It was pure color, musical harmony or dissonance.

He didn't talk to his mother about it, because she would be angry. She taught him to stay away from that place. In that place was madness, she told him. If he wasn't careful, it would swallow him. He would lose himself in that place. 

She taught him to build up a wall. To keep it isolated. To stay away from it.

It was dangerous, Louis knew. But he didn't think of it like a mirror. He thought of it like an echo chamber. Like an amplifier.

He'd tried to explain it to his mother. "When I'm feeling something ... if I'm scared or happy or whatever ... it goes down in there, where I can't see ... and it bounces around. It gets louder and louder, and it comes rushing out like ... like steam from a kettle--"

But his mother didn't want to hear about it. "You stay away from that place," she told him. "Stay away from the Dark Mirror of the Soul. If you are not careful, it will eat you up. Do you remember what I taught you?"

Louis remembered. 

"What do you do?"

Louis took a deep breath, and then another. He'd back away from the dark place. He'd back away from whatever it was that was making him upset. Making him feel something. He'd go outside, where he could be alone. Outside was the best (which was hard in the daytime, because the Lupus made it hard to be outside. The sunlight hurt his eyes and burned his skin and made his bright rosy rashes much worse), but anywhere there was space around him was okay. He would lie down on his back and stretch out his arms and legs and close his eyes and imagine he was floating on the surface of a perfect, peaceful lake, looking up at the moon. He'd push away whatever was making him upset. He'd push it down and away and breathe deep, concentrating on what it felt like to be floating on the surface of the water.

He'd breathe in, and when his lungs filled with air, his body would rise a little higher in the water. He'd breathe out, and his body would sink a little lower. He'd concentrate on the rhythm of his breath and he'd rise and fall in the water, feeling a little more relaxed with each wave.

"That's right," his mother had said. "You keep away from things that upset you. Push them down, and stay away from the mirror. Your dad got swallowed up by it. I'm not going to let that happen to you, Louis."

---

He should have been devastated, filled with crushing remorse--and maybe he was, on some level--but he didn't feel anything. That wasn't right. He felt strong. His rash had subsided. The sun didn't hurt his eyes. He had energy.

<!-- CHARACTER: Doctor Bellamy -->

Doctor Bellamy kept pushing Louis, encouraging him to "open up," to express himself and share his feelings.

"It's perfectly all right to feel sad or angry or guilty, Louis," Doctor Bellamy said. "Many survivors of violent incidents carry significant amounts of guilt, actually. It is natural to question the loss. Why did you survive where so many others have died? Others who may have deserved life more than you, no?"

"No." Louis said. 

Louis didn't want to be inside any more. He didn't want to express himself. He'd been taught his whole life to shut out anything that made him feel. It was dangerous for him to feel. He wasn't like other people. If he became upset or excited, the dark place inside him would grow. It would swallow him up.

Louis felt something he wasn't used to. A surplus of energy. The light wasn't hurting his eyes. His skin wasn't clear, exactly. But the red splotches of rash weren't so bright and weren't so itchy.

The dark place inside him, the *dark mirror,* was quiet. Strangely quiet. In fact, it had been abnormally still and silent since the incident at the patrol station, but Louis didn't notice. He'd long been in the habit of shutting out the darkness completely, like his mother had taught him. 

His mother had been terrified of that dark place. It was the darkness that took Louis' father away from her. She would not risk losing her son the same way. 

Louis' father had understood the importance of listening to the silence, of looking deeply into that *dark mirror of the soul.* When the time was right, the dark corner of his mind could be a great source of strength, he told Louis' mother. 

But it scared her. When he looked into that place, he became like an animal. She never told Louis how his father found hope there. She never told Louis how his father had said it was important to learn to work *with* the darkness, to listen to it, to understand its rhythms.

She had wanted Louis' father to shut it out completely, to turn away from the dark place forever. "I've seen you shut it out," she begged with him in desperation, patting her growing belly. "If not for me, then for the baby."

Louis' mother never told him about this conversation. She never told him how his father had answered her, "You can only run from your nature for so long," he said.

<!-- ACT TWO: Louis recognizes something different in his darkness, something crawling around in there. Doctor Durward (head doc @ Seven Oaks) welcomes louis to the asylum, recognizes Louis' dark place. Louis is soothed by Durward. "you are different, special. this is a place for people like you. you will be safe here. our residents will welcome you." louis lets his guard down. Durward is skeptical, cold: would perhaps rather not be stuck with Louis? set up Durward as a petty tyrant. she describes the scene as more of a challenge than a comfort. "If you can master yourself, you will find comfort here." (an interdiction to be violated) -->

Louis remembered the fair. The first part of the day there, at least. He normally would have avoided such an outing, but ... something was different in him. His symptoms had subsided since the incident at the Patrol station.

Since his mother had died, since the incident at the River Station, Louis had been living in a strange and quiet hell. He kept pushing his feelings down. Kept turning away from the fear, the terror, the sorrow and the loss. If he were to acknowledge any of it, the terrible darkness would overwhelm him. It would spread from that dark place in his mind until it filled the universe and swallowed him completely. He would be lost forever. 

And the darkness was unusually quiet. And Louis had a surplus of energy. And the attendant ward, Tank, had invited him out on a day trip to the fair, along with another patient. So he went. 

And what had happened? How did he get back to Seven Oaks? He couldn't remember.

The director of the Asylum, Doctor Kaylynn Durward, showed him the newspaper. "They say one of the performing bears escaped," she said.

"I don't remember," said Louis.

"Would you like to try?" asked the doctor. "Try and remember, Mister Blake. Tell me what happened."

Louis said nothing. He hated it when people treated him like a child. But this ... this 'Mister Blake' business was almost worse. Or maybe it was really just the same thing. She was being disingenuous, wasn't she? Addressing him with an honorific, with an adult title, just to emphasize the disparity between their positions. She, the director of the correctional asylum; he, a ward of the state, a minor and either a guest, patient or prisoner of the institution. He still wasn't sure which.

"You seem to have very bad luck, Mister Blake," Doctor Durward said. "First you lose your mother--so you say--in a drug cartel massacre on the banks of the Rio Grande, and then--"

"It wasn't a drug cartel slaying," Louis said.

"No? What was it, then, Mister Blake? Why don't you ... enlighten me?"

---

"This one is different," Louis' mother had said. "He's a doctor, but not like the others. He doesn't work in a hospital. People come from all over the world to see him. To be near him. To ask him for advice or to seek protections. He's a doctor, but he sees things that other people don't see. He feels things that other people can't feel. He's worked miracles. Cured incurable diseases. Given sight back to the blind. He's a miracle worker, Louis. A real miracle worker."

"Maybe he can help with ... the darkness ... the dark mirror ... maybe he can help with that too?" Louis said. He wanted to be normal above all things. To have a normal life. He wanted to run in the sunlight. He wanted to have friends. He didn't want to be pudgy and rash-riddled. He didn't want to live in fear of himself any more.

"Maybe he can, Louis. Maybe he can."
