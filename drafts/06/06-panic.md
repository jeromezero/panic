## PANIC attacks episode 06

### 01 - Intro

<!-- pre-existing conflict  / exposition -->

"Everyone keeps asking me how I feel. I'm sick of it. Stop treating me like
a sick child!  It's like you *want* me to be sick.  Like you want me to
suffer.  I am fine, okay?  I am fine.  Stop trying to make me feel sick all
the time.  Can't you just leave me alone?"

"But you *are* sick, Louis. You have lupus. It may be in remission now ...
and with proper treatment and care, you *can* lead a full life, but you
can't ignore the fact that you are sick.  You can't just pretend there is
nothing wrong with you.  There is *no cure,* Louis.  None.  You will carry
this for the rest of your life.  If you behave now as if there is nothing
wrong with you, you will pay for it later ..."

#### The kitchen

"Where do all these people come from?" Louis asked.

"We bus 'em up from the city," Cook said. And that was all.

"My name's Louis," Louis said, extending his hand.

"Huh," grunted Cook, livting a giant coffee carafe onto its stand.


### 02 - Complication / Conceit

<!-- encounter pre-existing conflict - Crossing The First Threshold -->

"Where's Daisy?" Louis asked.

Dr. Bellamy put down his notebook and removed his reading glasses. He carefully folded them and placed them on his notebook.

"Daisy's been transferred to the East Wing. Here injuries were ... significant."

"Is she going to be all right?"

"I hope so, Louis."

Doctor Bellamy studied Louis from behind the pyramid of his hands. He occasionally tapped the tips of his fingers together.

Louis studied the floor.

"You haven't asked about Tank, Louis. That's twice now that you have inquired after Daisy, but you haven't asked about Tank. Don't you care about Tank?"

Louis didn't know if he cared. He couldn't bear to think about it. Every time his thoughts approached ... he was filled with the sound of tearing flesh. Splashes of red blurred his vision. He couldn't bring himself to think Tank's name, let alone voice it out loud.

"You're trembling, Louis," the doctor said.

The sound of tearing flesh overwhelmed Louis' ears. He could see it coming apart. Splitting down a jagged seam to reveal shining white nodes of spinal column. Red. Through the air, an oval skull slightly off-center of a spinning pinwheel of vertebrae, spraying meat and red as it turned.

He couldn't bring himself to ask about Tank. He was terrified that he might already know the answer to any question he could ask.

<!-- ACT TWO: Long ago, Louis boarded up the dark place in the woods of his
mind.  A cave ...  He boarded it up, sealed it and let the path get
overgrown.  -->

<!-- ACT TWO:  Bellamy: "If you can master yourself, you will find comfort
here." (an interdiction to be violated) -->

<!-- ACT TWO: Doctor Bellamy: "The path has to be walked every day, Louis.
If you want to get better, you need to apply yourself.  This is no easy
thing here.  You can't rely on your mother's teat any longer.  If you don't
set some goals and work toward them, your life here will be miserable.  -->

<!-- ACT TWO: you are different, special. this is a place for people like
you.  you will be safe here.  our residents will welcome you.  Louis lets
his guard down.
-->


### 03 - Climax / Turning Point

<!-- Approach the Inmost Cave -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Bellamy pushes Louis closer to the darkness within him.
Closer than he wants to go.  He bullies him toward it.  When Louis
approaches it, there is something different about it.  Something unusual and
frightening.  He hears a voice whispering in the darkness - he can't make
out the words, but he hears cries of rage and anguish.  Claws scratching at
the door.  -->

<!-- ACT THREE:  Bellamy pushes Louis on a guided meditation. They walk down
the path together, clearing away the brush that has grown over it.  Louis is
reminded of his flight through the woods, his flight from the terrible
ordeal in which he lost his mother.  -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Louis is disturbed, frightened. Wants to stop. Bellamy
pushes him onward.  They arrive at the cave, and the boards have been
broken.  The bricks he carefully laid have been knocked in.  -->

<!-- ACT THREE: This is good, Bellamy says. "You can't keep your inner life
locked away.  You must confront it.  It may be difficult, especially if you
do not feel ready, but you must confront it." But no ...  nothing broke
*out* of the cave.  Something forced its way *in*.  Louis can hear it down
there ...  growling in pain and anger.  -->

<!-- ACT THREE: Louis turns away in fear. He breaks from the meditation. "I
can't ..." he says.  -->


### 04 - Falling Action / Suspense / Reversal / Spiral / Escalation

<!-- Reward - The Ultimate Boon -->

<!-- ACT FOUR: Back in the dorms, Louis is not welcomed. Other patients or
'guests' rattle their doors, smash their plates and scream at Louis.  They
sense something inside him.  Something lurking inside of Louis' dark place. 
Shannon Ulger is to be Louis' roommate, but he rails against Louis.  At
first he is hopeful.  They have something in common.  "I don't meet many of
our kind," he says.  But ...  "There is something in you ...  something
terrible," he says.  "Get it away.  Get away." He attacks Louis, who fears
for his life.  He is being beaten to a pulp when the wards come into the
room and stop the fight.  they haul Louis away and lock him in solitary
confinement.  -->


### 05 - Catastrophe / conclusion / resolution / denouement

<!-- Resurrection - Master of Two Worlds -->

<!-- ACT FIVE:  Louis: Why am I locked up? Why am I being punished? I was
attacked without reason ...  Bellamy: Louis ...  You had better pray that
Shannon survives.  You nearly killed him.  If you don't get a hold of your
rage ...  if you don't apply yourself, there is little we can do for you
here.  -->
