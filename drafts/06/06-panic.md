## PANIC attacks episode 06

"Where do all these people come from?" Louis asked.

"We bus 'em up from the city," Cook said. And that was all.

"My name's Louis," Louis said, extending his hand.

"Huh," grunted Cook, lifting a giant coffee carafe onto its stand.

Cook was a roundish and hard man. He reminded Louis of a ball of India rubber, with the shape of something gentle and soft, but unyielding beneath his white uniform. He joked every now and again, slapping his hands on his apron, as if dusting them of flour, but Louis had a hard time telling when Cook was being serious and when he was being otherwise.

"The coffee's really good," Louis said. "Thanks."

"It's the eggshells," Cook said. "Why don't you get over to the dining hall. Shannon is sorting donations. Sure he could use a hand."

"Everyone keeps asking me how I feel. I'm sick of it. Stop treating me like
a sick child!  It's like you *want* me to be sick.  Like you want me to
suffer.  I am fine, okay?  I am fine.  Stop trying to make me feel sick all
the time.  Can't you just leave me alone?"

"But you *are* sick, Louis. You have lupus. It may be in remission now ...
and with proper treatment and care, you *can* lead a full life, but you
can't ignore the fact that you are sick.  You can't just pretend there is
nothing wrong with you.  There is *no cure,* Louis.  None.  You will carry
this for the rest of your life.  If you behave now as if there is nothing
wrong with you, you will pay for it later ..."

"Where's Daisy?" Louis asked.

Dr. Bellamy put down his notebook and removed his reading glasses. He carefully folded them and placed them on top of his notebook.

"Daisy's been transferred to the East Wing. Here injuries were ... significant."

"Is she going to be all right?"

"I hope so, Louis."

Doctor Bellamy studied Louis from behind the pyramid of his hands. He occasionally tapped the tips of his fingers together.

Louis studied the floor.

"You haven't asked about Tank, Louis. That's twice now that you have inquired after Daisy, but you haven't asked about Tank. Don't you care about Tank?"

Louis didn't know if he cared. He couldn't think about it. Every time his thoughts approached ... he was filled with the sound of tearing flesh. Splashes of red blurred his vision. He couldn't even think his name, let alone voice it out loud.

"You're trembling, Louis," the doctor said.

The sound of tearing flesh overwhelmed Louis' ears. He could see it coming apart. Splitting down a jagged seam to reveal shining white nodes of spinal column. Red. Through the air, an oval skull slightly off-center of a spinning pinwheel of vertebrae, spraying meat and blood as it turned.

He couldn't bring himself to ask ... he was terrified that he might already know the answer to any question he could ask.

---

Louis went to work in the kitchen, helping to prepare a daily free lunch for the downtrodden.    

---

"You're different, Louis. You are special. My special little man." Louis could still hear his mother's voice. When he pulled the raspy covers up to his chin, untucking the sheets at the bottom of the cot to give himself a little more slack, he heard her voice, just barely buried by the rustling covers.

"What's that, Mom?" he said once, before realizing his mistake.

The silent room echoed back at him. The other patients, in their own cots, were silently stifling their snickers. Laughing themselves to sleep over his fragile vulnerability. 

---

Louis couldn't stop shaking. He was always shaking. 

"Your office is cold," he told Doctor Bellamy.

"It's seventy-eight degrees," the doctor said.

"I can't stop shivering," Louis said.

"This place isn't going to be easy for you, Louis," Bellamy said. "But it can be good for you."

"Yeah, yeah," Louis said, dismissively. "You get out of it what you put into it. Right?"

"How are you getting along with the other residents?"

---

In the middle of the night, when Louis should have been sleeping, he heard claws scratching at the door. He heard whispers in the halls. He couldn't make out any words, but someone out there, somewhere, was in pain.

He couldn't tell if he was awake or asleep. The night went by slowly, and it felt like he'd been listening to the sounds of the old building forever, but when the lights went up, he though he couldn't have been there for more than an hour or two.

"Morning already?" Louis said. "How did that happen?" he asked no one in particular. 

"Like this, Kid," Shannon Ulger, the weird old man from the garden, said, sitting on the edge of Louis' cot. He looked Louis in the eye and opened his hand, counting out the digits one at a time, "Eleven ... Twelve ... One ... Two ... Three ... and so on." Shannon laced up his shoes and shuffled out into the hall.

"You can't keep your inner life locked away like this, Louis," Doctor Bellamy said. "It isn't healthy. You must confront it. I know it is difficult. Especially when you don't feel ready. But sometimes in life, you need to confront things when you aren't prepared to confront them. But remember, it is *you.* A part of you, locked away. It is something primal, something scared or something angry. The sounds you hear ... the howls and the voices down inside of you ... the harder you push it down, the more violent it gets. It is you, Louis. And you need room to breathe. You can't keep yourself locked away forever. That's where these outbursts are coming from, don't you see? If you don't find an outlet, an avenue of expression for the aggressions, anxieties and fears you bottle up inside you, they will come roaring out, all on their own, as you have seen. We don't have to do it all at once, Louis. But you can't keep putting it off. Your episodes will only get worse. You have to let yourself *out,* Louis. You have to let yourself breathe."

"But that isn't it at all, Doctor. Something happened out there. Out at the abandoned patrol station on the banks of the Rio Grande. Something broke *in.* something from out there ... something that doesn't belong. Sure. There was a part of me that needed to get out. There was a part of me that I'd locked away, but ... It isn't there anymore. Something from out there came in ... when it happened ... when I went under. It came in and destroyed that part of me. It killed that part of me and took its place. And now--"

"That's enough of this, Louis. I know it can feel that way. I know it isn't easy. But I assure you, what you are feeling is perfectly normal. You are, however, taking it to an extreme. You have to do the work, Louis."

"But I am doing the work. I am in the kitchen--"

"That is not the work I am talking about, Louis. And you know it. The kitchen work is good work. You are starting to fit in, starting to work your way into the system here, but the *inner* work, Louis. That is what you are really here for. That is the work--"

"I can't."

"You must." 

"I'm trying."

---

The yellowing wallpaper curled away from the walls where they met the ceiling. The paper stretched and cracked as the hall shifted, swelling and contracting with the continual flux of arrhythmic in-and-exhalations.

If he looked closely, Louis could see things crawling around beneath the paper, inside the walls.

He wasn't sure if the voices he heard were coming from the dorm-rooms or from inside of his own head, so he ignored them. 

Screams of pain and frustration poured into the hall as Louis passed.
Tortured laughter came out through the gaps under the closed doors and 
slid across the floor, welling up around his ankles, tripping him up, making him stumble.

---

Cook put eggshells and cayenne pepper in with the coffee grounds. He said the eggshells absorbed the acids and the pepper brought a little life into the tired, cheap stuff.

---

"I don't often meet *our kind* of folk," Shannon Ulger said, sitting on the edge of Louis' cot.

"What do you mean, *our kind?"* Louis asked.

Shannon tilted his head back and inhaled a deep long breath through his nose. The air whistled through his perforated septum. "I've got it in me too," He said. "Can't you tell? Can't you see it, when you look at me? Can't you smell it? We're invited to the same parties, you and me."

Louis threw off his covers and stood up on the cot. The metal frame and springs creaked and groaned under him.

Louis' eyes rolled back into his head, and a deep gurgling growl started turning in the back of his throat. He shivered violently.

Shannon sniffed the air again, faster now, in quick pulsing breaths. His expression changed. He looked uncertain. As if he had made a terrible mistake, an only just realized it.

"No," Shannon said, his voice shaking. He stood up and backed away from the bed. "No."

Louis dropped his pajama pants and started to urinate all over his bed. The stream was wild and unpredictable. It sprayed out in shaky, scattering arcs from Louis' shivering body, spattering on the bedclothes and splashing on the wooden floor. The growling in the back of his throat rose higher and louder.

Other voices rose in the darkness. Voices of sleepers awakening into confusion. Laughter.

"The new kid's pissing his bed!"

Shouts of disgust and the sound of footsteps running. The lights flashed on. A sleepy-eyed orphan stood with his hand on the switch.

"We're not vermin, are we?" The snide and snarling voice of the Attendant Ward echoed down the hall, and all the other sounds fell away, except that of the growling cry escaping from Louis' throat and the now trailing off spatter of urine. "It's your fucking job, *Charlie.* Isn't it?"

And then the door swung wide and as chaos erupted in the dorm. Later, no one could really agree on what had happened after that.

---

Louis woke up in a darker sort of darkness. His body hurt, and he couldn't move his hands. He couldn't move his arms at all. He could sort out his feet, rock them back and forth a little bit, but he was wrapped up tight. He tried to stand, but could not. He was half-propped against a cold wall. Sitting in a corner. It was damp and he was shaking. Pain snaked its way through his skeletal system.

"Hello?" he croaked.

"Good morning, Louis," Doctor Bellamy said, his voice crackling through an old electric speaker system.

"Doctor?" Louis said. "What's happening? I can't move."

"If you don't apply yourself, Louis, there isn't much we can do for you."

"What's happening?"

"Don't bother struggling, Louis. The restraints are quite secure. You nearly killed Mister Ulger, Louis. Pray that he recovers. If you don't get a hold of yourself ... if you don't get a hold of your rage--"
