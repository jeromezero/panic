I didn't know what kind of story this was supposed to be. I boarded the plane hungover and read up on it. I figured it was going to be an exploitation piece. Some human interest nightmare to fill a few columns behind the latest Bat-Boy drivel.

I wasn't looking forward to the correctional asylum. I'd visited enough of those places. 

Poor fucking kid. Lost everything. He'll be a wreck. And here I come, the press corp cavalry. But not to save the day. I'll put him up--not on a pedestal, but in a cage. I'll hang the cage out in public, and I'll poke and prod the kid for reactions. I'll put him on display. I'll make a spectacle of him. Of his misfortunes and deformities.

What's the angle? That's what Bishop wants to know. Always looking for the angle. I told her it was about a sick kid and his overprotective mother. She wasn't impressed.

"Its about the failings and shortcomings of modern medicine," I said.

"Better," she said. "Think bigger."

"It's about the insurance marketplace and the President's Health Care reform bill," I said. "One kid who fell through the cracks. A single Mom and her struggle to find health care for her terminally-ill child. The government mandated an insurance package--but it covered nothing. Every circumstance conspired to disqualify the kid from coverage. Mom was driven to seek alternatives. She went all new age and shit. Put her kid through intense LSD therapy, shock treatment, isolation hydrotherapy."

"The anti-presidential policy angle always goes over with our readers, but can't you play up the violence? Think bigger, but not bigger politics ... lets focus on mom's death. The brutality of it. She was dismembered, after all. Wasn't she?"

"She joined a cult. The government pushed her into the jaws of a cult killer. She fell for some new-age healer, but really he was a drug dealer." 

"Satanist drug dealers. Good idea. More of them"

"You know these Mexican drug dealers. A superstitious lot. They are always praying to idols and invoking the saints and shit. They offer up their enemies to the gods. Human sacrifice--"

"This single mom is the enemy of Mexican drug cartels?"

"There's still some work to do. But the vision is coming together.
