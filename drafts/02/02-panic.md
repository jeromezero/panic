### Drug Cartel Massacre or Satanic Ritual Gone Wrong?

The morning after the River Station Massacre, two miles inland from the abandoned border patrol station where the brutal slayings took place, Louis Blake plunged naked through razor-sharp cordgrass and thickets of mesquite, following the sound of gunfire, praying it might save his life.

He stumbled out of the humid, South Texas brush onto the delivering end of a recreational shooting range and collapsed out of relief and exhaustion. It was eleven o'clock in the morning, Friday, June 13.

<!-- TODO: is "delivering end of range awkward? I could bring back the Vangelis quote? "He scared the hell out of us, but thank God he came up behind us. At least we didn't shoot him." or some shit like that. -->

According to Brownsville police, Blake's presence and proximity to the massacre is entirely coincidence. "He had nothing to do with the River Station incident," said Desk Sergeant Doug Douglas. "The River Station Incident was Mexican drug traffickers killing Mexican drug traffickers and dropping their bodies on American soil. They think they can get away with anything. They think they've got *protection*." 

But recovered evidence doesn't fit the drug cartel pattern, said Cameron County Justice of the Peace (Precinct 1) Paula Miller, who signed the autopsy reports. "This looks like something else. I don't want to speculate, but if pressed, I'd say this was some sort of Satanic rite or ritual killing gone wrong."

According to Miller, there were two classes of victim: a group of men wearing robes and bearing marks of ritual scarification--all of whom have remained unidentified; and a group of eight identified Americans, all of whom had voluntarily ceased receiving treatment for serious medical conditions within the last year. The robed men tortured and mutilated the Americans, until something interrupted them and tore them limb from limb. "I don't know what it was," said Miller. "Maybe it was a bear, maybe it was a demon, maybe it was God's vengeance."

The Brownsville Police Department vehemently disagrees with statements made by Miller, who, under pressure from the authorities, subsequently retracted her commentary.

"This was Mexican drug traffickers killing Mexican drug traffickers," Douglas insisted. "And Blake is no Mexican drug trafficker." He slapped a photograph onto the surface of his desk. A head shot of Louis Blake--a pale, pudgy teen with a shock of short but unruly brown hair. His cheeks and the bridge of his nose are rosy with dense acne or some sort of rash.

"These kids take too much LSD and get lost out in the bush," said Douglas. "It happens all the time. He's lucky he found Masey's instead of the massacre."

Masey's Gun Shop and Shooting Range is a moated fortress on the banks of the Rio Grande. Guests literally fire across the river into Mexico. It's about five miles West of the Gulf of Mexico and about 20 miles East of Brownsville--where the closest E.R. is located.

"[Blake] was in bad shape," said Martin Shipley, who'd brought his fiancee, Lisa Vangelis, to Masey's to break in her new pink shotgun. "That kid had been through Hell. No doubt about it."

"We could see he needed help, real bad," Vangelis said. "There was blood all down his legs, and he was swollen and blotchy, with scabs all over. It was real ugly."

Shipley and Vangelis aren't the kind of folks to wait around for someone to come along and save them. "I've always preferred to 'take matters into my own hands,'" Shipley said. So they didn't bother to call the police. 

"Valley Baptist [E.R.] ain't 20 miles away, but on these roads, even an ambulance would take 40 minutes to get out to the range," Shipley said. "I knew I could make it in 30." 

They wrapped Blake in a foil blanket and hoisted him into the back of their blue 2000 Dodge Ram. 
<!-- Patriot Blue Pearl is the paint color -->

"Lisa was riding in the back with the kid," Shipley said. "And up till now, he'd been pretty quiet. I mean, he hadn't been moving much or anything, but when we got to the turn--Brownsville and the E.R. to the Left, and the Gulf to the right--the kid woke up for real."

"He started screaming and hollering," Vangelis said. "He was banging on the window, trying to get Marty's attention. He made us pull over and he told us about what happened. He said there was some healing thing do be done out by the river, but it wasn't no doctor. It was a killer. 'He killed that lady,' he said. He pointing out toward the gulf, crying for his Mamma. Said she was still out there. Said we had to save her." 

"Once he told his story, I knew we couldn't leave his momma out there," Shipley said. "Not if there was a chance she was still alive. We've never been the kind to sit and wait around for the authorities to come along and handle our business for us. If something needed doing, we were the ones to do it."

"If there was some kind of trouble, we were ready," said Vangelis. "Marty just bought me this nice pink shotgun--for our engagement--and I ain't never been scared of trouble. So we headed to the right instead of making left for the E.R. We were gonna save his momma, if we could."

### discovery of the scene

A couple of miles to the east, a little less than half way to the mouth of the Rio Bravo, Louis led the couple off the main road and on to an overgrown dirt track called Quicksilver Avenue. As they rode toward the abandoned ruins of an old patrol station, Shipley's truck
<!-- Patriot Blue Pearl 2000 Dodge Ram  -->
tore up any tracks that may have been used to ID a vehicle that had been up or down that road in the last 24 hours.

Shipley and Vangelis plunged headlong into a scene of death and gore. It was more than they were prepared for.

Vangelis can't talk about it. She breaks down in tears when I push her for details. "It was some kind of Voodoo witchcraft," she says. "There was an altar, with signs drawn on it. Burnt-out candles. A metal bucket on the floor. It had been full of blood, but it was spilled. And in the ... it looked like a heart. Like a brain, or a part of one. Fingers," she struggles to get this much out. Her voice is quavering and she stutters, trying to find the words and the courage to share what she has seen. "Worse," is all she can muster before she turns away.

Shipley and Vangelis said they had no way of telling how many bodies there were. "There was more blood than I've ever seen," Shipley said. "And I've bled out a six hundred pound Elk." 

There were no intact bodies, only pieces, Shipley said. A hand torn from its joint. A section of spine. Fragments of Skull. Some larger pieces. Unidentifiable, but for occasional clumps of hair and scraps of clothing.

Statements issued by the Brownsville Police department have so far denied the extent of such mutilations or any evidence of witchcraft.

### A Foreign Perspective

Officers on the other side of the river aren't surprised by Shipley and Vangelis' statements, however. Antonio Alonso, a crime scene investigator for the Matamoros Police Department, says this kind of thing happens all the time on his side of the Rio Bravo.
<!-- NOTE: in Mexico, it's called the Rio Bravo, in US, the Grande -->

"There is very little we discover on such scenes," Alonso said, pulling his dusty white cowboy hat lower over his eyes. "It is not safe to search them before they have been cleansed."

The Matamoros Police Department has barely any detectives left, Alonso said. They have been murdered, most of them. Those that are left are to frightened to do their work. 

When they come across a crime scene with signs of witchcraft, they wait for a curandero--a kind of blue-collar shaman--to dispel the evil before they enter. Unfortunately, this often means the destruction of evidence ... 
<!-- TODO: @now [seriously] (2) work this quote -->
"But it it better to be alive ... and in this life, there are worse things than being dead, even."

"Perhaps your Brownsville Police have their own curandero," Alonso said.

### One Flawed Witness

Louis Blake is now being held for treatment at the Seven Oaks Asylum.
<!-- TODO: (8) location for the Seven Oaks Asylum -->.
Authorities have as of yet been unable to locate his mother. She was not one of the bodies identified among the River Station Massacre remains.

According to Blake, the River Station Massacre was supposed to be a healing ceremony. "He was supposed to make me better," Blake said. "He was supposed to make us all better."

Blake suffers from Lupus. His skin is thin and blotchy. Sunlight gives him headaches and makes him break out in an itchy red rash. He is weak and exhausted all the time.

Lupus, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue. The underlying causes are not fully understood. There is no known cure.

Blake's mother, Helen James, home schooled him and kept him isolated from the outside world. For as long as he can remember, she dragged him across the country, chasing medical trends and rumors, subjecting him to one experimental treatment after another. Even when the resources of Western Medicine had been exhausted, she searched on, trying to find a cure in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicines. Finding no luck there, she subjected Blake to an exorcism and a round of LSD therapy.  

During our conversation, Blake appeared to be sedated, though a deep-seated nervousness showed through the cloudy glaze of his eyes. He kept looking over his shoulder at the two solidly-built attendant wards who stood at either side of the door with their arms crossed in front of them, giving the impression of prison guards more than that of health care professionals.

"Did they catch him?" was the one question on Blake's lips. "Did they catch the Doctor?"

According to Blake, his mother found a spiritual healer, Don Oscuro, who promised to perform a special healing ceremony that would clear away his Lupus forever. The ceremony was to include six other patients, all suffering from different ailments. Oscuro pulled them all together, to meet "in a very special place, on the last full moon of the year," Blake said. In addition to the patients and a handful of accompanying family members, "There was the Doctor, and four or five other people with him. People we didn't know. He said they were there to help with the ceremony. He didn't have the strength to do this kind of healing alone, he said. He needed help."

<!-- TODO: seven patients with 7 incurable conditions -->

While Blake spoke, he scratched idly at the back of his hands and wrists, and popped his jaw every so often with a yawn-like motion that produced a soft clicking sound. 

Blake has gaps in his memory. He remembers the beginning of the night, the dilapidated condition of the abandoned station. "It was like a ruin," he said. "The roof was off. but once he ... once he ... started to cut her ... I guess I blacked out. The next thing I remember ... I'm in the woods, and the sun is up. There's this crackling sound of fireworks or gunfire, and I'm running toward it, trying to get there."

Blake remembered being shocked at the condition of the abandoned station. "It was ... not just rundown, it was like ruins--the roof was off," he said. Men in came in wearing robes and carrying metal buckets. "I thought they were paint buckets, but when they opened them up, it stank. Real bad. They were stirring them up with these long sticks, and they brought out Mrs. Jenkins--she had some kind of Jacob's Disease, I think. Dementia and all. But then the doctor was there. Don Oscuro. He was naked. He took off all Mrs. Jenkins' clothes."

Blake started shaking as he spoke. He was scratching at his wrists and arms with more vigor, but without seeming to notice what he was doing.

"The guys who had been stirring the buckets helped him," Blake said. "They held her down. They were singing. The Don had a big knife. Like a machete. He cut open her head while they were holding her. He reached in and scooped ... out of her head ... into the bucket."

Blake was getting quite agitated. He started hyperventilating as he scratched at himself. Not just at his wrists and arms, but all over his chest and at his neck.

The two attendant wards rushed over and injected Blake with something. "A sedative," one of them said.

"He has terrible panic attacks," the other ward said.

<!-- end here? -->

While sedatives may ease Blake's panic, at least temporarily, they do little to answer the implicit questions.

Who is this Doctor? Why did he torture and kill these suffering, terminally-ill patients? What went wrong? Was there some sort of animal attack? Did anyone other than Blake survive? Had the doctor done this sort of thing before? Is he still alive? Will he strike again?

## Addendum - notes from the reporter's journals

> This was a tough one to work. In the end, much of Campbell's material found its way to the cutting room floor.

> What follows is a collection of loose elements and excerpts from the rough drafts of the story. There were several threads I found to be of particular interest, especially those concerning Blake's mother and one Monsieur Faustrodamus, who provided background color and texture to the piece, but little concrete value.

"We don't want to release any information that could compromise our investigation in any way," said Brownsville Desk Sergeant Doug Douglas.

I tried speaking with the investigating officers, to no avail. After much struggle and runaround, I cornered one of the initial responders. "I'm a man of the law, and I have never ... knowingly ... acted in a way that would interfere with the upholding of said law," said investigating officer Robert Cole. 
<!-- CHARACTER: Investigating Officer Robert Cole -->

It was just about the only thing I could get him to say on the record. And he had a hard time saying it. He patted his pockets down as if he misplaced a prepared statement. Maybe he was struggling to recall what his commanding officer had instructed him to say if he were ever cornered by a nosy reporter.

These cops came off like a superstitious bunch. Maybe Alonso had been on to something. If they thought the crime scene were cursed, or filled with 'bad magic,' where would they turn?

I checked around with local churches, but got nowhere. I scoured the classifieds. I called a 'Discrete Occult Consultant.'

"Monsieur Faustrodamus is out of the office," a perky-sounding receptionist said through the phone.

She didn't know when he'd be back, but assured me he'd call at his earliest convenience to set up a consultation.

"I'm desperate," I told her. "I don't know where else to turn. I just bought a house. It's next to an old graveyard. I didn't think anything of it at the time ... but ..." I made up a yarn about strange noises in the yard. A midnight terrier terrorized us. Impregnated my sweet precious Donuts. Donuts was my dog. My precious little Bichon Frisé. And now she had a litter of Demon Puppies growing inside her. I needed help. I'd tried everything. I told her I'd spent a fortune on doggy psychiatrists already. I went on, making it clear that money was no concern. I could hear the dollar signs falling into place behind her eyes. I could hear it through the phone line.

She told me to drop by the office.

Turns out, she didn't know where Monsieur Faustrodamus was. She hadn't heard from him in days.

No, she didn't think anything had happened to him, "He does this sometimes," Charlotte Baroque said. In person, the receptionist was every bit as perky as her phone demeanor had promised. "Especially when he's completed a difficult cleansing. That really took takes it out of the Monsieur."

Sure, I thought. Every time he gets a big payday, it's off to the races. 

"Can he can handle a situation with ... discretion?" I asked.

"Oh, the Monsieur is discrete as discrete can be," Charlotte assured me. "In fact ... he often works with the police department."

Do I smell a cookie?

NOTE to Editor: 

> Elizabeth, you know I couldn't care less about cars, but you always insist on auto-details, so I asked Blake about the car his mother drove down to TX. What a coup! (pun intended).

> It took a stroke of chance, but I found the car. You are right again. I shouldn't question you.

Helen Blake's rust-spotted Ford fiesta gathered dust in the parking lot of the Apache Motor Lodge, a rundown Brownsville motel.

In the abandoned Fiesta: stolen prescription pads and a significant supply of experimental Intravenous Immunoglobulins--synthetic steroids used for patients who have not responded well to other Lupus treatments.

There was no Helen James on the hotel register, but by a bit of luck, I walked away with her assumed name, Anita Baker. 

Anita Baker worked as an RN in an Arkansas hospital under a forged set of Nursing Credentials. The only medical schooling she had was a first—aid course and a couple of workshops.

It appears that she conned her way into the nursing profession in order to provide her son with access to drugs and treatments he could not otherwise afford.

---

I worked on the Apache Motor Lodge concierge. Luck was with me. He let me into James/Baker's room. where I found her journals.

She'd been working dawn the list of Lupus treatments, Logging the results diligently. Her journals showed an increasing dissatisfaction with western medicine. 

As her faith in Western medical practice eroded, it was replaced by an increasing interest in alternative methods. She tried many things out on her son, including LSD therapy. She wrote some glowing notes regarding this process, but determined that ultimately, something else needed to be done. Though the LSD therapy had opened up new pathways of thought and new possibilities.

Entries showed an almost delusional increase in hope after she met "the Don." the progression of entries illustrates an evolution of faith and belief in what appears to be a spiritual or--dare I say it--a Cult Leader.

There are very few concrete details in her journal, so far as the identity of the mystic DOCTOR is concerned. But the journal clearly illustrates and describes the coming of a great opportunity. A healing workshop on the Rio Bravo. On the night of the full moon.

There was a mini-fridge locked in the closet of the hotel room. moved it from the kitchenette into the closet, running a bright orange extension cord to keep it powered. It was humming along when I came in. She'd mounted a padlock on the closet door herself--don't think I've ever seen a hotel room with locking closets. She mounted the padlock, but the latch was just screwed onto the wood on the outside. I had to make a trip to the hardware store, but I unscrewed the latch and granted myself access to the mini-fridge. There was half a bottle of white wine and a small wedge of Brie. 

<!-- NOTE: incident takes place on June 12, 2014 -->

I got a call from Faustrodamus' assistant, Charlotte Baroque.

<!-- CHARACTER: Charlotte Baroque -->

Faustrodamus had returned. But he not feeling well. He was in no shape to work. I could hear the terror in Baroque's voice. The truth of the matter was, she didn't know who to call. Faustrodamus was a wreck. She'd never seen him like this.

I rushed over to his office. He'd been on a drunk all right. But not some celebratory affair. He was shaken to the core. It was about ten in the morning and he was shaking, reeking of last nights beer and this morning's Whiskey. He was shouting and packing a suitcase. "Come on, Charlie, it' s time to get out here, " he said. "I've never seen anything like that. A little blood, I can handle. A murder or two, I'm your man. I've seen corpses plenty. But now the bottoms dropped out of this whole country. What's that? You're goddamned right it's the Mexicans. We've get to get away from this border, Charlie. It's worse than a war zone. It's been a war zone for years. This is hell. This is the gates of hell opening wide to unleash terrors onto the earth the likes of which man was not meant to see. No ma'am. It's back to Wisconsin for us, Charlie,"

"He's been like this all morning," Charlie said.

"This is about Quicksilver Lane, isn't it?" I said.  

This was the first thing said that pulled Faustrodamus out of his self-obsessed panic. He hadn't appeared to hear a word spoken up ts this point. He hadn't even acknowledged my presence.

"Who the fuck is this?" he said. "What the fuck is he doing here?"

This is the gentleman with the dog," Charlotte said, sounding rather unsure of herself now.

"Really?" Faustrodamus said. "You expect me to believe that?"

Faustrodamus looked me in the eye. "You don't look like a rich faggot with a ponce poodle to me," he said.
