## episode two: in the news

### Lous stumbles out of the bush

Louis Blake came wandering out of the humid, semi-tropical brush, stumbling through razor-sharp cordgrass and thickets of mesquite at about nine in the morning on June 24th. He was a hysterical mess, naked and bleeding from dozens of scrapes, cuts and whipmarks. 

"He was in bad shape," said Martin Shipley, who'd brought his fiancee to Masey's Gun Shop and Range for a little celebratory shooting--They'd just announced their engagement and were embarking on a planned weekend getaway. A weekend filled with romance.

"Thank God he came up behind us," Shipley said. "Scared the Hell out of us, but at least we didn't shoot him. 

Masey's Gun Shop and Shooting Range is a moated fortress on the Rio Bravo. Guests literally fire across the river into Mexico. It's about five miles West of the Gulf and about 20 miles East of Brownsville--where the closest E.R. is.

"First, I thought he was one of them Mexicans," Shipley said. "We get 'em coming over the wall every now and again." 

There was a bit of a commotion. "Nobody knew what to do," Shipley said. "We could see he needed help, reall bad. So I wrapped a foil blanket around him and put him in the back of the truck. Well ... He had a good deal of blood on him. I didn't know if he was still bleeding or not. So we put him in the back. It wasn't that bad. Lisa jumped in back too. To help keep him calm. Try to clean up his blood and what not. We got on the road. I was gearing up to make a left. Take the kid to Valley Baptist. I could hear him screaming in the back. I thought something terrible--I was scared for Lisa. Thought for a minute I'd made a big mistake putting her in the back with him ... But she was alright. Just wanted me to open the window."

"He started screaming for his Mamma," said Lisa Vangellis, Shipley's fiancee. "He kept saying she was still out there. Pointing back to the right, back to the Gulf."

"He said she was in some kind of trouble. We knew he needed help. But he wasn't bleeding. And he put up such a fight ... And if his Mamma was out there ... I mean ... we called the 911, but we were 40 minutes away from anywhere. We couldn't leave her out there. And if there was some kind of trouble ... we were ready. Marty just bought me this pink shotgun, and I aint never been scared of trouble."

### discovery of the scene

A couple of miles to the east, a little less than half way to the mouth of the Rio Bravo, Louis led the couple off the main road. There is an abandoned structure off Quicksilver avenue. 
The overgrown dirt track is called Quicksilver Avenue. As they rode toward the abandoned ruins of a patrol station, Shipley's wine-colored 2000 Dodge Ram tore up any tracks that may have remained -- obliterated any forensic evidence that might have been used to ID a vehicle that had been up or down that road in the last 24 hours.

There were no other survivors. Shipley and Vangellis plunged headlong into a scene of death and gore. Just what they saw has been the subject of much debate, as Law Enforcement officials initially denied--or at the very least, attempted to downplay--the gravity of the situation / the extent of the carnage.

Vangellis can't talk about it. She breaks down in tears when I push her for details. "There was a spilled bucket," she says. "A metal bucket, It had been full of blood. And on the ground ... it looked like a heart. Like a brain, or a part of one. Fingers," she struggles to get this much out. Her voice is quavering and she stutters, trying to find the words and the courage to share what she has seen. "Worse," is all she can muster before she turns away.

Shipley and Vangellis said they had no way of telling how many bodies there were. "There was more blood than I've ever seen," Shipley says. "And I've bled out a 350 pound Bighorn. A six hundred pound Elk." 

There were no intact bodies, only pieces. A hand torn from its joint. A section of spine. Fragments of Skull. Some larger pieces. Unidentifiable, but for clumps of hair and scraps of clothing. A lone shoe. Buckets of blood.

The police report, released days later, when it finally acknowledged the presence of blood and human remains, made no mention of buckets containing bloor or other body parts. The official position denies the presence of such macabre paraphanelia.

### a foreign perspective

Officers on the other side of the river aren't surprised by Shipley and Vangellis' statements, however. Antonio Alonso, a crime scene investigator for the Matamoros Police Department, says this kind of thing happens all the time on his side of the Rio Bravo.

"There is very little we discover on such scenes," Alonso said. "It is not safe to search them before they have been cleansed."

Alonso pulls his dusty white cowboy hat lower over his eyes. 

The Matamoros Police Department has barely any detectives left, he told me. They have been murdered, most of them. Those that are left are to frightened to do their work. 

When they come across a crime scene with signs of Witchcraft, they wait for the Curandero to dispell the Evil before they enter. Unfortunately, this often means the destruction of evidence ... "But hey, it it better to be alive ... and in this life, there are worse things than being dead, even."

Alonso asks me if I am sure our Texas investigators have not done something similar.

I compare Vangellis and Shipley's stories with the news-clippings, with the official Police Reports. There are discrepancies. I ask Vangellis and Shipley for a follow-up interview. They had been quite supportive and willing to cooperate initially, but now, for whatever reason, they refuse to talk with me.

But it is beginning to come clear, the crime scene was interfered with several times before the investigating officers claimed the crimescene.

* Vangellis and Shipley's truck obliterated whatever tracks may have been left on the drive.
* Vangellis and Shipley had run of the place for an undisclosed amount of time. "It could have been an hour," Shipley said. "It felt like *forever*," Vangellis said.
* Alonso believes that investigating officers themselves may have had the space cleansed before they entered. It is common practice for a police department south of the border have a Curandero on payroll.

I tried speaking with the investigating officers, to no avail. They, of course, admitted to no such thing. After much struggle and runaround, I cornered one of the initial responders. "I'm a man of the law, and I have never ... knowingly ... acted in a way that would interfere with the upholding of said law." investigating officer Robert Cole said. It was just about the only thing I could get him to say on the record. And he had a hard time saying it. He patted his pockets down as if he misplaced a prepared statement. Maybe he was struggling to recall what his commanding officer had instructed him to say if he were ever cornered by a nosy reporter.

Off the record, I got just one other thing out of him. "Call me Bobby," Cole said. 

### occultist

Law enforcement has been very tight-lipped concerning the whole affair. 

"At this point, we don't want to release any information that could compromise our investigation in any way," was all I could get out of Chief Doug Douglas.

<!-- TODO: does chief need to be capitalized here? in such as Chief Doug Douglas. ? -->

I wanted to know just how compromised the crime scene was before the investigation had a chance to get underway.

The Brownsville cops weren't giving me anything, and a little snooping around revealed they had no shaman or witchdoctor on payroll, but they came off like a superstitious bunch.

I made some calls. I scoured the classifieds. I found a number that looked promising.

"Monsieur Faustrodamus is out of the office," a perky-sounding receptionist said through the phone.

She didn't know when he'd be back, but assured me he'd call at his earliest convenience to set up a consultation.

"I'm desperate," I told her. "I don't know where else to turn. I just bought a house. It's next to an old graveyard. I didn't think anything of it at the time ... but ..." I made up a yarn about strange noises in the yard. A midnight terrier terrorized us. Impregnated my sweet precious Donuts. Donuts was my dog. My precious little Bichon Fris√©. And now she had a litter of Demon Puppies growing inside her. I needed help. I'd tried everything. I told her I'd spent a fortune on doggy psichiatrists already. I went on, making it clear that money was no concern. I could hear the dollar signs falling into place behind her eyes. I could hear it through the phone line.

She told me to drop by the office.

Turns out, she didn't know where Monsieur Faustrodamus was. She hadn't heard from him in days.

No, she didn't think anything had happened to him, "He does this sometimes," Charlotte Baroque said. In person, the receptionist was every bit as perky as her phone demeanor had promised. "Especially when he's completed a difficult cleansing. That really took takes it out of the Monsieur."

Sure, I thought. Every time he gets a big payday, it's off to the races. I also thought "Bingo." I hated myself a bit for thinking it.

"He's recently completed a difficult cleansing?" I asked. I fished around, dropping hints that I wanted to know about Faustrodamus' track record. "I don't need names, of course," I said. "I just ... would like to know that he can handle a situation with ... discretion."

"Oh, the Monsieur is discrete as discrete can be," Charlotte assured me. "In fact ... he often works with the police."

Maybe it was a long shot. But I wanted to talk to FaustroDingus.

### the victims

Piece by piece, the story (and the corpses) came out. There were remains of at least seven individuals that looked to have been killed at the site, on the night in question. There were also bits and pieces of several other people that had been killed some time before. These were the organs, the fingerbones, the chunks of brain that, according to Shipley and Vangellis, had been putrifying in the buckets of blood. These had been brought to the scene.

Of the other corpses, five were identified as patients--terminally ill or otherwise incurable. Due to the condition of the bodies, and of the scene, an exact number of corpses could not be determined. The estimate now stands at 11 to 13 deceased.

Louis Blake says there were 7 patients, including himself. Various family members accompanied them. "There was the Doctor," Blake said. "And four or five people he had with him. People we didn't know. He said they were there to help with the ceremony. He didn't have the strength to do this kind of healing alone, he said. He needed help."

This checks out. 

<!-- TODO: seven patients with 7 incurable conditions -->

"There were two classes of victim," said Suzanne Ochoa, Brownsville Coroner who did the autopsies. "These young, ill victims that have been carefully worked over--they have the marks of ritual sacrifice and torture on them. They were carefully, deliberately, ritualistically treated. And these others ... The others were torn apart. Literally ripped limb from limb. Some of them look as if they had been caught in an explosion, others as if they had been mauled by a wild animal. At least three of these 'others' have a similar pattern of scar tissue--geometric scarring on the back of their shoulders and on their necks."

### Louis' Family life.

Louis Blake has Lupus. He's never been the active kind. He didn't get out much. He couldn't stand bright lights. Sunlight gave him headaches and rashes.

Blake thinks he's sixteen years old, but he isn't too sure. 

He doesn't have any friends. I can't find any school records. His mother, Helen Blake--quite deceased now--had been living under the name Anita Blakely, and working as a nurse in Arkansas. She homeschooled Louis. 

Lupus, or Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune dissease that causes the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue. The underlying causes are not fully known. The list of common symptoms is long, and Louis suffered from many of them.

* chronic chest pain
* fatigue
* spontaneous fevers
* joint pain
* sensetivity to sunlight
* mouth sores
* an itchy "butterfly" rash that gets worse in sunlight
* abnormal heart rhythms
* chronic nausea and vomiting

According to Blakeley's journals (more on them later), Lois couldn't bear to be outside. The sunlight made him worse. Kids made fun of him if they ever saw him.

So she kept him at home. She homeschooled him and dedicated her life to finding a cure for him. To treating him at least.

It was difficult to find anyone who knew the Blakes. Family friends were nonexistent. I eventually tracked down Murphy Charles, an Arkansas nurse who worked beside Blakely. 

"I can't really tell you much about Anita, Charles said. "She was always looking to pick up extra shifts. Didn't socialize too much with the other nurses. I tried to ask her out one time, but she turned me down. I didn't feel to bad about it. She turned everybody down. Like I said, she didn't socialize much.
