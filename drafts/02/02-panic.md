## episode two: in the news

### Lous stumbles out of the bush

Louis Blake came wandering out of the humid, semi-tropical brush 
stumbling through razor-sharp cordgrass and thickets of mesquite at about nine in the morning on June 24th. He was a hysterical mess, naked and bleeding from dozens of scrapes, cuts and whipmarks. 

"He was in bad shape," said Martin Shipley, who'd brought his fiancee to Masey's Gun Shop and Range for a little celebratory shooting--They'd just announced their engagement and were embarking on a planned weekend getaway. A weekend filled with romance

"Thank God he came up behind us," Shipley said. "Scared the Hell out of us, but at least we didn't shoot him. 

Masey's Gun Shop and Shooting Range is a moated fortress on the Rio Bravo. Guests on the shooting range literally fire across the river into Mexico. It's about five miles West of the Gulf and about 20 miles East of Brownsville--where the closest E.R. is.

"We get 'em coming over the wall every now and again," Shipley said.

There was a bit of a commotion. "Nobody knew what to do," Shipley said. "We could see he needed help, reall bad. So I wrapped a foil blanket around him and put him in the back of the truck. Well ... He had a good deal of blood on him. I didn't know if he was still bleeding or not. So we put him in the back. It wasn't that bad. Lisa jumped in back too. To help keep him calm. Try to clean up his blood and what not. We got on the road. I was gearing up to make a left. Take the kid to Valley Baptist. I could hear him screaming in the back. I thought something terrible--I was scared for Lisa. Thought for a minute I'd made a big mistake putting her in the back with him ... But she was alright. Just wanted me to open the window."

"He started screaming for his Mamma," said Lisa Vangellis, Shipley's fiancee. "He kept saying she was still out there. Pointing back to the right, back to the Gulf."

"He said she was in some kind of trouble. We knew he needed help. But he wasn't bleeding. And he put up such a fight ... And if his Mamma was out there ... I mean ... we called the 911, but we were 40 minutes away from anywhere. We couldn't leave her out there. And if there was some kind of trouble ... we were ready. Marty just bought me this pink shotgun, and I aint never been scared of trouble."

### discovery of the scene

A couple of miles to the east, a little less than half way to the mouth of the Rio Bravo, Louis led the couple off the main road. There is an abandoned structure off Quicksilver avenue. 
The overgrown dirt track is called Quicksilver Avenue. As they rode toward the abandoned ruins of a patrol station, Shipley's wine-colored 2000 Dodge Ram tore up any tracks that may have remained -- obliterated any forensic evidence that might have been used to ID a vehicle that had been up or down that road in the last 24 hours.

There were no other survivors. Shipley and Vangellis plunged headlong into a scene of death and gore. Just what they saw has been the subject of much debate, as Law Enforcement officials initially denied--or at the very least, attempted to downplay--the gravity of the situation / the extent of the carnage.

Vangellis can't talk about it. She breaks down in tears when I push her for details. "There was a spilled bucket," she says. "A metal bucket, It had been full of blood. And on the ground ... it looked like a heart. Like a brain, or a part of one. Fingers," she struggles to get this much out. Her voice is quavering and she stutters, trying to find the words and the courage to share what she has seen. "Worse," is all she can muster before she turns away.

Shipley and Vangellis said they had no way of telling how many bodies there were. "There was more blood than I've ever seen," Shipley says. "And I've bled out a 350 pound Bighorn. A six hundred pound Elk." 

There were no intact bodies, only pieces. A hand torn from its joint. A section of spine. Fragments of Skull. Some larger pieces. Unidentifiable, but for clumps of hair and scraps of clothing. A lone shoe. Buckets of blood.

The police report, released days later, when it finally acknowledged the presence of blood and human remains, made no mention of buckets containing bloor or other body parts. The official position denies the presence of such macabre paraphanelia.

### a foreign perspective

Officers on the other side of the river aren't surprised by Shipley and Vangellis' statements, however. Antonio Alonso, a crime scene investigator for the Matamoros Police Department, says this kind of thing happens all the time on his side of the Rio Bravo.

"There is very little we discover on such scenes," Alonso said. "It is not safe to search them before they have been cleansed."

Alonso pulls his dusty white cowboy hat lower over his eyes. 

The Matamoros Police Department has barely any detectives left, he told me. They have been murdered, most of them. Those that are left are to frightened to do their work. 

When they come across a crime scene with signs of Witchcraft, they wait for the Curandero to dispell the Evil before they enter. Unfortunately, this often means the destruction of evidence ... "But hey, it it better to be alive ... and in this life, there are worse things than being dead, even."

Alonso asks me if I am sure our Texas investigators have not done something similar.

I compare Vangellis and Shipley's stories with the news-clippings, with the official Police Reports. There are discrepancies. I ask Vangellis and Shipley for a follow-up interview. They had been quite supportive and willing to cooperate initially, but now, for whatever reason, they refuse to talk with me.

But it is beginning to come clear, the crime scene was interfered with several times before the investigating officers claimed the crimescene.

### the victims

Piece by piece, the story (and the corpses) came out. There were remains of at least seven individuals that looked to have been killed on at the site, on the night in question. There were also bits and pieces of several other people that had been killed some time before. These were the organs, the fingerbones, the chunks of brain that, according to Shipley and Vangellis, had been putrifying in the buckets of blood. These had been brought to the scene.

Of the other corpses, five were identified as patients--terminally ill or otherwise incurable. Due to the condition of the bodies, and of the scene, an exact number of corpses could not be determined. The estimate now stands at 11 to 13 deceased.

Louis Blake says there were 7 patients, including himself. Various family members accompanied them. "There was the Doctor," Blake said. "And four or five people he had with him. People we didn't know. He said they were there to help with the ceremony. He didn't have the strength to do this kind of healing alone, he said. He needed help."

This checks out. 

<!-- TODO: seven patients with 7 incurable conditions -->

"There were two classes of victim," said Suzanne Ochoa, Brownsville Coroner who did the autopsies. "These young, ill victims that have been carefully worked over--they have the marks of ritual sacrifice and torture on them. They were carefully, deliberately, ritualistically treated. And these others ... The others were torn apart. Literally ripped limb from limb. Some of them look as if they had been caught in an explosion, others as if they had been mauled by a wild animal. At least three of these 'others' have a similar pattern of scar tissue--geometric scarring on the back of their shoulders and on their necks."

### Louis' homelife

Louis Blake has Lupus. He's never been the active kind. He didn't get out much. He couldn't stand bright lights. Sunlight gave him headaches and rashes.

His mother, Anita Blake, Homeschooled him.  

Mother worked as a nurse
Mother distrusted western medicine

she was constantly on the lookout for alternative medicines and treatments.
over the years she tried

<!-- TODO: three examples of alternative treatments Louis' mother tried. Or perhaps two. Third time is the charm, after all-->

* example - LSD therapy
* example
* example

Met the DOCTOR - a man who was too good to be true
DOCTOR gathered a group of people in need of healing

Who was this DOCTOR? why did he lure these ill people out into the desert?
