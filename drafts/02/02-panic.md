## episode two: Here is the News

Louis Blake plunged naked through razor-sharp cordgrass and thickets of mesquite, following the sound of gunfire, praying it might save his life. His pale, sixteen-year-old body was torn, bleeding and swolen, covered in angry welts and lacerations.

When he stumbled out of the humid, South Texas brush onto the delivering end of a recreational shooting range, he collapsed out of relief and exhaustion. It was eleven o'clock in the morning, Friday, June 13. 

<!-- lone survivor of a mass killing - more to the mass killing than previously known! -->

Masey's Gun Shop and Shooting Range is a moated fortress on the banks of the Rio Grande. Guests literally fire across the river into Mexico. It's about five miles West of the Gulf and about 20 miles East of Brownsville--where the closest E.R. is located.

"He was in bad shape," said Martin Shipley, who'd brought his fiancee, Lisa Vangellis, to Masey's to break in her new pink shotgun. 

"That kid had been through Hell," Shipley said. "No doubt about it."

<!-- 2014-06-18 | 11:26:29 -->

'Hell' didn't even begin to describe it.
The extent of Blake's suffering would unfold over the days to come. No one could imagine the terrors he had endured, the terrible nightmares he had been exposed to.

---

"Thank God he came up behind us," Vangellis said. "Scared the Hell out of us, but at least we didn't shoot him." 

"We could see he needed help, real bad," Vangellis said. "He came up out of nowhere and just fell over. There was blood all down his legs, and he was swollen and blotchy, with scabs all over. It was real ugly."

"Valley Baptist ain't but 20 miles away, but on these roads, even an ambulance would take 40 minutes to get out to the range," Shipley said. "I knew I could make it in 30."

Shipley and Vangellis aren't the kind of folks to wait around for someone to come along and save them. "I've always preferred to 'take matters into my own hands,'" Shipley said. So they wrapped Blake in a foil blanket and hoisted him into the back of their blue 2000 Dodge Ram. 
<!-- Patriot Blue Pearl is the paint color -->

"Lisa was riding in the back with the kid," Shipley said. "And up till now, the kid had been *out.* I mean, he just collapsed at our feet and hadn't been moving much or anything, but when we got to the turn--Brownsville and the E.R. to the Left, and the Gulf to the right--he woke up for real."

"He started screaming and hollering," Vangellis said. "I couldn't hardly understand him, but he was pointing out to the right and shouting for his Mamma. Said she was still out there."

<!-- TODO: pickup edit -->

"... And if his Mamma was out there ... I mean ... we called the 911, but we were 40 minutes away from anywhere. We couldn't leave her out there. And if there was some kind of trouble ... we were ready. Marty just bought me this pink shotgun, and I ain't never been scared of trouble."

### discovery of the scene

A couple of miles to the east, a little less than half way to the mouth of the Rio Bravo, Louis led the couple off the main road and on to an overgrown dirt track called Quicksilver Avenue. As they rode toward the abandoned ruins of an old patrol station, Shipley's truck
<!-- Patriot Blue Pearl 2000 Dodge Ram  -->
tore up any tracks that may have remained -- obliterated any forensic evidence that might have been used to ID a vehicle that had been up or down that road in the last 24 hours.

There were no other survivors. Shipley and Vangellis plunged headlong into a scene of death and gore. Just what they saw has been the subject of much debate, as Law Enforcement officials initially denied--or at the very least, attempted to downplay--the gravity of the situation / the extent of the carnage.

Vangellis can't talk about it. She breaks down in tears when I push her for details. "There was a spilled bucket," she says. "A metal bucket, It had been full of blood. And on the ground ... it looked like a heart. Like a brain, or a part of one. Fingers," she struggles to get this much out. Her voice is quavering and she stutters, trying to find the words and the courage to share what she has seen. "Worse," is all she can muster before she turns away.

Shipley and Vangellis said they had no way of telling how many bodies there were. "There was more blood than I've ever seen," Shipley says. "And I've bled out a 350 pound Bighorn. A six hundred pound Elk." 

There were no intact bodies, only pieces. A hand torn from its joint. A section of spine. Fragments of Skull. Some larger pieces. Unidentifiable, but for clumps of hair and scraps of clothing. A lone shoe. Buckets of blood.

The police report, released days later, when it finally acknowledged the presence of blood and human remains, made no mention of buckets containing blood or other body parts. The official position denies the presence of such macabre paraphernalia.

### a foreign perspective

Officers on the other side of the river aren't surprised by Shipley and Vangellis' statements, however. Antonio Alonso, a crime scene investigator for the Matamoros Police Department, says this kind of thing happens all the time on his side of the Rio Bravo.
<!-- NOTE: in Mexico, it's called the Rio Bravo, in US, the Grande -->

"There is very little we discover on such scenes," Alonso said. "It is not safe to search them before they have been cleansed."

Alonso pulls his dusty white cowboy hat lower over his eyes. 

The Matamoros Police Department has barely any detectives left, he told me. They have been murdered, most of them. Those that are left are to frightened to do their work. 

When they come across a crime scene with signs of witchcraft, they wait for the curandero to dispel the evil before they enter. Unfortunately, this often means the destruction of evidence ... 
<!-- TODO: work this quote -->
"But it it better to be alive ... and in this life, there are worse things than being dead, even."

Alonso asks me if I am sure our Texas investigators have not done something similar.

I compare Vangellis and Shipley's stories with the news-clippings, with the official Police Reports. There are discrepancies. I ask Vangellis and Shipley for a follow-up interview. They had been quite supportive and willing to cooperate initially, but now, for whatever reason, they refuse to talk with me.

But it is beginning to come clear, the crime scene was interfered with several times before the investigating officers claimed the crime scene.

* Vangellis and Shipley's truck obliterated whatever tracks may have been left on the drive.
* Vangellis and Shipley had run of the place for an undisclosed amount of time. "It could have been an hour," Shipley said. "It felt like *forever*," Vangellis said.
* Alonso believes that investigating officers themselves may have had the space cleansed before they entered. It is common practice for a police department south of the border have a Curandero on payroll.

I tried speaking with the investigating officers, to no avail. They, of course, admitted to no such thing. After much struggle and runaround, I cornered one of the initial responders. "I'm a man of the law, and I have never ... knowingly ... acted in a way that would interfere with the upholding of said law." investigating officer Robert Cole said. It was just about the only thing I could get him to say on the record. And he had a hard time saying it. He patted his pockets down as if he misplaced a prepared statement. Maybe he was struggling to recall what his commanding officer had instructed him to say if he were ever cornered by a nosy reporter.

Off the record, I got just one other thing out of him. "Call me Bobby," Cole said. 

### occultist

Law enforcement has been very tight-lipped concerning the whole affair. 

"At this point, we don't want to release any information that could compromise our investigation in any way," said Brownsville Police Chief Doug Douglas.

I wanted to know just how compromised the crime scene was before the investigation had a chance to get underway.

The Brownsville cops weren't giving me anything, and a little snooping around revealed they had no shaman or witchdoctor on payroll, but they came off like a superstitious bunch.

I made some calls. I scoured the classifieds. I found a number that looked promising.

"Monsieur Faustrodamus is out of the office," a perky-sounding receptionist said through the phone.

She didn't know when he'd be back, but assured me he'd call at his earliest convenience to set up a consultation.

"I'm desperate," I told her. "I don't know where else to turn. I just bought a house. It's next to an old graveyard. I didn't think anything of it at the time ... but ..." I made up a yarn about strange noises in the yard. A midnight terrier terrorized us. Impregnated my sweet precious Donuts. Donuts was my dog. My precious little Bichon Frisé. And now she had a litter of Demon Puppies growing inside her. I needed help. I'd tried everything. I told her I'd spent a fortune on doggy psychiatrists already. I went on, making it clear that money was no concern. I could hear the dollar signs falling into place behind her eyes. I could hear it through the phone line.

She told me to drop by the office.

Turns out, she didn't know where Monsieur Faustrodamus was. She hadn't heard from him in days.

No, she didn't think anything had happened to him, "He does this sometimes," Charlotte Baroque said. In person, the receptionist was every bit as perky as her phone demeanor had promised. "Especially when he's completed a difficult cleansing. That really took takes it out of the Monsieur."

Sure, I thought. Every time he gets a big payday, it's off to the races. I also thought "Bingo." I hated myself a bit for thinking it.

"He's recently completed a difficult cleansing?" I asked. I fished around, dropping hints that I wanted to know about Faustrodamus' track record. "I don't need names, of course," I said. "I just ... would like to know that he can handle a situation with ... discretion."

"Oh, the Monsieur is discrete as discrete can be," Charlotte assured me. "In fact ... he often works with the police department."

Maybe it was a long shot. But I wanted to talk to Faustrodamus.

### the victims

Piece by piece, the story (and the corpses) came out. There were remains of at least seven individuals that looked to have been killed at the site, on the night in question. There were also bits and pieces of several other people that had been killed some time before. These were the organs, the fingerbones, the chunks of brain that, according to Shipley and Vangellis, had been putrefying in the buckets of blood. These had been brought to the scene.

Of the other corpses, five were identified as patients--terminally ill or otherwise incurable. Due to the condition of the bodies, and of the scene, an exact number of corpses could not be determined. The estimate now stands at 11 to 13 deceased.

Louis Blake says there were 7 patients, including himself. Various family members accompanied them. "There was the Doctor," Blake said. "And four or five people he had with him. People we didn't know. He said they were there to help with the ceremony. He didn't have the strength to do this kind of healing alone, he said. He needed help."

This checks out. 

<!-- TODO: seven patients with 7 incurable conditions -->

"There were two classes of victim," said Suzanne Ochoa, Brownsville Coroner who did the autopsies. "These young, ill victims that have been carefully worked over--they have the marks of ritual sacrifice and torture on them. They were carefully, deliberately, ritualistically treated. And these others ... The others were torn apart. Literally ripped limb from limb. Some of them look as if they had been caught in an explosion, others as if they had been mauled by a wild animal. At least three of these 'others' have a similar pattern of scar tissue--geometric scarring on the back of their shoulders and on their necks."

### Louis' Family life.

Blake suffers from Lupus. His skin is thin and blotchy. Sunlight gives him headaches and makes him break out in an itchy red rash. He is weak and exhausted all the time.

Blake thinks he's sixteen years old, but he isn't too sure. 

He doesn't have any friends. I can't find any school records. His mother, Helen Blake--quite deceased now--had been living under the name Anita Blakeley, and working as a nurse in Arkansas. She home schooled Louis. 

Lupus, or Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue. The underlying causes are not fully known. The list of common symptoms is long, and Louis suffered from many of them.

* chronic chest pain
* fatigue
* spontaneous fevers
* joint pain
* sensitivity to sunlight
* mouth sores
* an itchy "butterfly" rash that gets worse in sunlight
* abnormal heart rhythms
* chronic nausea and vomiting

According to Blakeley's journals (more on them later), Lois couldn't bear to be outside. The sunlight made him worse. Kids made fun of him if they ever saw him.

So she kept him at home. She home schooled him and dedicated her life to finding a cure for him. To treating him at least.

It was difficult to find anyone who knew the Blakes. Family friends were nonexistent. I eventually tracked down Murphy Charles, an Arkansas nurse who worked beside Blakely. 

"I can't really tell you much about Anita, Charles said. "She was always looking to pick up extra shifts. Didn't socialize too much with the other nurses. I tried to ask her out one time, but she turned me down. I didn't feel to bad about it. She turned everybody down. Like I said, she didn't socialize much. She was always worried about her kid. She was single ... I asked her, but she she said she didn't have time for  social life. She was always reading up on healthcare concerns. Alternative treatments were a really big thing for her. She got in trouble once or twice for recommending people sacrifice their treatment in favor of some new wave hippy bullshit. That's not how Johanesson described it, those aren't the words he used, but that's what he meant. 'You represent the group,' he told her. 'You can't go around sending people to non-FDA approved treatment centers. You can't recommend witchcraft as a viable treatment for heart disease or kidney failure.'"

Bingo.

Charles said she was reading up on "all kinds of reference books. Stuff we had studied back in school--stuff *I* had studied back in school. Anita read a lot of textbooks. That was one thing that got me to thinking I had a chance with her, actually. She asked me if I had any of my old textbooks laying around, and could she come over to borrow some ... so she could, you know ... review them. I thought for sure she was into me. I mean, come on. That was a transparent excuse for a come-on if I ever saw one. I was thinking *conjugal visit* all the way. But I was wrong. She came over, driving a beat up old hatch-back. What kind of car was it? I'm not sure exactly. It was off-white, had a few rusty patches ... It looked like one of them old VW rabbits."

Blakeley drove a 1975 Ford Fiesta. I found that car a few days later, parked outside the Apache Motor Lodge, a rundown Brownsville hotel.

---

There wasn't a lot that the Fiesta offered. Nothing immediately promising at least. But keep it in mind. We may return to it later.

Turns out, Anita Blakeley wasn't a nurse at all. At least, not an accredited Nurse. She forged her credentials. She had taken a first—aid course, attended a couple of workshops.

Her son Louis Blake, had been diagnosed with Lupus some years earlier. Blakeley did everything in her power to get treatment for him. but nothing worked. She didn't have any money. “He  didn't have insurance. She conned her way into the nursing profession in order to provide her son with access to drugs and treatments he could not otherwise afford.

This is, of course, pure speculation. But there is evidence ts support it, In the abandoned Fiesta, investigators discovered stolen prescription pads and a significant supply of experimental drugs used in the treatment of Lupus.

<!-- TODO: insert Lupus treatment drug here. -->

"She was a smart cookie," said Charles. "Never forgot a fact or a figure. She returned my textbooks in a week. She asked me to quiz her. Just wanted to keep sharp, she said. I'd struggled with the material fer years. 

She took about two semesters worth of books. Chewed them up in about four days. Had me quiz her on it pretty extensively. Went back through my old papers and all. She nailed them. Aced the quizzes I'd struggled with. That's when I figured she was just' doing a refresher. No way she had just picked up that material fer the first time."

Anita Blake's real name was Helen.

"She smoked menthol cigarettes," Charles said. "I thought that was strange, this day and age. For a nurse to be such a heavy smoker. Net unheard of, I guess, but I certainly thought it was strange. She had this funny way of exhaling, she'd put her lips together and blow out this little focused jet. It was like a smoke laser."

At first, Blakely had devoured everything, She chewed up all the cutting-edge Lupus treatments, stole all the prescriptions and treatments she could get her hands on. She made a list of all the common Lupus treatments, from the most promising to the most obscure.

She went right down the line. Using her stolen prescription pads. She kept logs. These were found in the hotel room. I found the car in the parking lot of the cheap hotel. This is how I found the hotel.

Anita Blake and her son rented a room by the week, and had paid in up to the end of the month.
<!-- TODO: quote from hotel employee / manager -->

Helen had been living under the name Anita Blakeley, but the Hotel he'd been booked under her real name, Helen Blake, 

I was the first to find the car.

It was chance, really. I was driving around in circles, thinking about what Charles had. said. I'd only asked about the car because my editor loved shit like that. Whenever I talked to anybody ... she didn‘t give a shit about much of what I get out of an interview, so long as I get the make and model of the car they drive. Elizabeth Bishop is one hell of an editor. This bit about the cars--I'd long scoffed at it. But she'd drilled the habit into me. And in this case, it paid off. Big time.

There it was, the car Charles had described to me, parked in the lot of the Apache Motor Lodge. "Weekly rates and free HBO," the sign read.

I lied through my teeth to the hotel manager. Told him I was worried about my cousin. She'd come to town to visit me. Her and her kid. I Hadn't seen them for about a week, and I was worried. I thought maybe they'd been in a car wreck or they left town without saying a word. But that was their car right out in the lot. It looked like they were still around, after all. 

Something prompted me to hold back. i don‘t know what it was. Dumb luck, maybe, or some voice whispering up from down below . . . but I didn't use any names. I had been about to ask about my cousin, 'Anita,' but I held back. Instead I left out the name. But the front desk clerk conveniently supplied it for me.

I thought I'd lost the trail when he said "Helen," but I couldn‘t just turn around and walk out of there. Other details fit. She was a nurse, staying there with her son, about 15 or 16 years old. Last name Blake instead of Blakely. Their rent had been due two days ago. but she'd been staying with them for a while now.  Always been good about paying up front, so they hadn't tried to clear her stuff out yet. 

After some work, he let me into the room. where I found her journals.

She'd been working dawn the list of Lupus treatments, Logging the results diligently. She went through periods of great hope and optimism followed by extreme disillusion and hopelessness. I had seen journals like this before. My own notebooks, from earlier in life, when I was struggling with my then-undiagnosed case of bi-polar personality disorder. But that is neither here nor there. The point is that the journals became increasingly frustrated with and skeptical of the western medical tradition at large.

Also, there was a mini-fridge locked in the closet of the hotel room. moved it from the kitchenette into the closet, running a bright orange extension cord to keep it   powered. It was humming along when I came in. She‘d mounted a padlock on the closet door herself--don't think I've ever seen a hotel room with locking closets. She mounted the padlock, but the latch was just screwed onto the wood on the outside. I had to make a trip to the hardware store, but I unscrewed the latch and granted myself access to the mini-fridge. There was half a bottle of white wine and a small wedge of Brie. I don't know what I had been expecting, but it was something more then this

Blake's journal showed an increasing dissatisfaction with western medicine. This attitude been echoed by Charles' comments regarding her tendency to recommend alternative treatments to established patients of the medical group.

As her faith in Western medical practice eroded, it was replaced by an increasing interest in alternative methods. This much has been established. She tried many things out on her son, including LSD therapy. She wrote some glowing notes regarding this process, but determined that ultimately, something else needed to be done. Though the LSD therapy had opened up new pathways of thought and new possibilities.


The last series of entries are what really took me, though.

> I‘ve found the answer. I am sure of it now, in ways I've never been sure of anything before. The DOCTOR is in!

> He is quite a charmer. And a handsome devil too, though you‘d never catch me saying such a thing in public.


There are probably better parts of her journal to quote, but the progression of entries illustrates an evolution of faith and belief in what appears to be a spiritual lea-leader or, dare I say it, a Cult Leader.

There are very few concrete details in her journal, so far as the identity of the mystic DOCTOR is concerned. But the journal clearly illustrates and describes the coming of a great opportunity. A healing workshop on the Rio Bravo. On the night of the full moon.

<!-- NOTE: incident takes place on June 12, 2014? -->

June 12, 2014 

*There would be six(?) other patients. We are really very lucky 110 be admitted to to this ceremony,* Helen Blake wrote, *The others will pay $60,000 each for the service, but the DOCTOR has chosen to work with us for only $10,000. Truly the stars are smiling upon us.*

Just as I was going over this portion of Blake's notebooks, I sot a call from Faustrodamus' assistant, Charlotte Blank.

Faustrodamus had returned. But he not feeling well. He was in no shape tn work. Charlotte tried to give me the brush—off, but I could hear the terror in her voice. The truth of the matter was, she didn't know who to call. Faustrodamus was in quite a State. He was a wreck. She'd never seen him like this.

I rushed over to the office. He'd been on a drunk all right. But not some celebratory affair. He was shaken to the core. It was about ten in the morning and he was shaking, reeking of last nights beer and this morning‘s Whiskey. He was shouting and packing a suitcase. "Come on, Charlie, it‘ s time to get out here, " he said. "I‘ve never seen anything like that. A little blood, I can handle. A murder or two, I'm your man. I've seen corpses plenty. But now the bottoms dropped out of this whole country. What's that? You're goddamed right it's the Mexicans. We've get to get away from this border, Charlie. It's worse than a war zone. It's been a war zone for years. This is hell. This is the gates of hell opening wide to unleash terrors onto the earth the likes of which man was not meant to see. No ma'am. It's back to Wisconsin for us, Charlie,"

"He's been like this all morning," Charlie said.

"This is about Quicksilver Lane, isn't it?" I said.  

This was the first thing said that pulled Faustrodamus out of his self-obsessed panic. He hadn‘t appeared to hear a word spoken up ts this point. He hadn't even acknowledged my presence.

"Who the fuck is this?" he said. "What the fuck is he doing here?"

This is the gentleman with the dog," Charlotte said, sounding rather unsure of herself now.

"Really?" Faustrodamus said. "You expect me to believe that?"

Faustrodamus looked me in the eye. "You don't look like a rich faggot with a ponce poodle to me," he said.
