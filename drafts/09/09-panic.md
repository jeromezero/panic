<!-- STATUS: outline -->

Louis is out on his own now. He's in his teens, starting to lose the babyfat that has been with him up until the last weeks / months of his life. After he lost his family and shit got weird, that's when he started to lose the weight and all that.

He's pursued by Shannon, who is somewhat sympathetic to Louis, and a great deal frightened of him as well. Left on his own, Shannon would steer far clear of louis and never let himself be troubled by thoughts of the kid again. 

But ...  

Shannon is driven after Louis by Doctor Bellamy.

Doctor Bellamy is fascinated by, and wants to study Louis. He also believes there is no other hope for Louis. He is doomed to a very short life and a violent death if he does not accept his nature and allow Bellamy to help him, as he helped Shannon.

Shannon came to him at a very different time in his life. He is older, and found his own coping mechanisms--though many of these turned out to be 'unhealthy' in the greater scheme of things. He is struggling to recover from substance abuse problems and his habit of running away instead of emotionally engaging with his situation and surroundings has left him disconnected and lonely, to say the least. He is beholden to Doctor Bellamy in ways beyond what is apparent on the surface.

Doctor Bellamy is in turn pursued by the Asylum Director, Doctor Durward. Durward is furious that Louis has been allowed to disappear. She had been ready to hand the kid off to an alleged family member ...

Shannon doesn't believe for a minute that the woman who claims to be Louis' Aunt is any blood relation. 

Bellamy reminds Shannon that his theories and beliefs are held in very low regard.

"If there were blood between them, I'd smell it," Shannon says.

Bellamy scoffs. "Some wolf. What good is a hound without a sense of smell?" Shannon destroyed his nose with cocaine and crystal. "You've burned out your nose. You're not a wolf. You're barely even a dog. A dog scared of his shadow. A dog thats been beat too many times ..."

Bellamy and Shannon, driving through the night, tired and running out of rope, but unable to give up the pursuit, as they are hounded by Durward.

They ask some questions about Louis, following up on a lead. At a farm. Reports of animal attacks. Losing sheep. They follow railway corridors. Little avenues of greenway through the countryside.

Bellamy tries a tact as honest as he can: we heard about you losing a sheep to a wolf or a wildcat or something ... The sheriff sent us over.

yep, that's right. We never had a problem with wild animal attacks before, but about a week and a half ago ...

And have you seen this kid, by any chance?

What? Why's that?

Well ... he's a good enough kid, but he might be more trouble than he's worth. He was up at the Seven Oaks. Lost his Ma recently, and well ... he gets these panic attacks sometimes ... lot of fury, lot of violence in that kid, he sometimes directs it in bad ways ... We brought a little dog in to see him. Sometimes kids need comfort, you know ... Dogs can be wonderful therapy for troubled folks ... and ... Louis hasn't hurt anybody. Not any people. But we are worried. Look at this picture. We left him unsupervised with the puppy. Thought if they spent a night together ... but ... he did this with his bare hands. He gets these overwhelming panic attacks. Can't control his anger. Guy's been through a lot. Can hardly blame him, but ... he needs help. We're afraid he might hurt someone. Afraid he might hurt himself.

You think he might have mauled our sheep?

It's a long-shot. But a possibility.

No. We ain't seen him.

---

honey ... you think louis could have done that? To the sheep? to that puppy?

I don't think so. But even if ... with the puppy ... that thing wasn't gored in the same way. Teeth. Claws. Cuts and tears ...

How many patients? There were seven in all. Seven hounds on Oscuro's trail.

Seven sins, seven offences. Seven wrathful deities chasing Oscuro to the ends of the earth. 

He made a bargain with forces of the outer worlds. They gave him great power and vision, but when time came to pay the price, he skipped out. He preyed on the weak, as he always did. He lured the sick and the desperate out to a shack on the border and he called down the hunters. He had a trick up his sleeve and he planned to play it. 

Oscuro walked into the wind with a gun and a grin. 

He shouted to the heavens and he prayed for salvation. He whipped himself across the back with his fronds or wands or scraps of hazel or whatever wood was suitable for the whipping.

<!-- TODO: suitable switch for flagellation. something for Oscuro to smack himself with in ritual - what wood? what material? -->

Oscuro went to some bordertown clubs in Matamoros. He picked up a young american guy, a guy looking to party. To have a good time. To get fucked up. 

Oscuro promised him drugs, girls, a better party. An underground party, where all the sexy people would be. 

The kid couldn't resist. The way Oscuro painted the picture, the way he described it ... he was salavating at the mouth. This was what he was looking for--to be initiated into the elite.

They drove into a warehouse district.

"This is where the party is," Oscuro said. "Where nobody can be bothered ... where the sound ... doesn't bother ... anybody."

"I don't hear any music," said the kid.

Oscuro pushed him into an empty industrial building and slipped zap-straps around his wrists. He secured him to exposed pipes.

The kid started to struggle, but not hard enough. 

"You never believe the end will come, do you? Always you think, in a moment, this will pass. You think 'this too will pass,'  but this is not the case. This will not pass.  This moment will not end. 

<!-- 2015-01-30 | 23:11:34 -->

---

Oscuro bought time by sacrificing some kid. Some kid with a family that cared about him, but ... that's another story for another time. 

He worked up protection for smugglers and dealers ... for runners and "Venue" controllers. 

<!-- TODO: what's the name for a controlled smuggling market? an avenue? a realm? a ... what? there's a name for it, I know. can't think of it at the moment. -->

<!-- 2015-02-02 | 21:39:06 -->

What are you looking for? Shannon asks

Goddamned gas station doesn't have a phone booth. No phone booth.

You don't get out much, do you?

Durward wanted updates, to be informed as the information formed into lumps and slid in from the peripheries. As the coagulations slid toward the heart.

Why don't you use my phone? It's a piece of shit, but it works.

Shannon holds out a flip-phone to the doctor.

Where'd you get this?

Whaddya mean, where did I get this? The more pertinent question is why you don't have one--

But the doctor isn't listening any more, he's got the phone wedged between his face and his shoulder and he pulls the cap off a ballpoint pen with his teeth, letting it fall into his lap while he tries to maneuver a notepad into position against the steering wheel. The phone keeps slipping down his face and he 

Apparently, to stave off some massive lawsuit, that's what we're doing here, Bellamy tells Shannon. Kid's family is furious he's disappeared. Holding the Oaks liable and Durward's holding me liable, and I don't know if we can just hand the kid over to her, but we certainly can't just let him go. He's a danger. But I don't need to tell you that.

You don't know the half of it, Doc. The kid's got issues. 

That's why you're here.

Kid's got issues beyond what I've got. Beyond what I can help with. Kid's ...

---

All right. Bellamy says into the phone. Yes, I've got the address. Rural Route twenty six.

Who you talking to?

Doesn't matter. Livestock maulings been reported up on--

Route Twenty Six, I heard.

---

Oscuro's body itches with excitement. Is this what fear feels like? He can't remember, try as he might.

<!-- 2015-02-03 | 20:25:43 -->

He remembers what it was like to be hungry. To *desire.* To want more. Oscuro remembers what it was like to want. This is something he knew very well. But did he know fear? Did he ever know fear?

He can't remember.

He listens to the wind.

*They are **coming** for you, Don,* the wind says.

Don Oscuro laughs. "They will not like what they find," he says.

"What's that?" Kevin says.

"This way, Carl. The girls are this way," Oscuro says in soothing tones.

"It's Kevin," Kevin says.

"Hmm? Oh yes, fine," Oscuro says. "Very fine."

"Seems like a strange place to have a party," Kevin says.

"There are no neighbors to bother."

"Yeah. I guess so."

...

"But ... where is everybody? I mean ... no neighbors to bother, sure. But what's to bother them? I don't hear any music or voices. There's no cars out here. There's no lights on, even. I mean, come on, man. Where are you taking me?"

"No party here. Here, we pick up the drogas, then ... the party ... and the girls."

"Oh yeah, man ... I can dig that. The *dro*gas. We pick up the *dro*gas! ***Drogas!***


---

Kevin's parents didn't understand him. Really? that's what he wants to lead
with?

No. He doesn't want to lead with that. They have a good relationship,
really. They love and support him. Only maybe a little too much is the only
thing that ever could bother Kevin. His life is too boring. He hasn't had to
struggle all too much ... It's not that he's from a rich family. 

He isn't spoiled. He's had to work. He didn't have big family bucks behind
him to pay for an Ivy league or an A-list school. He earned some
scholarships, took out a few loans, blah blah blah. They weren't rich enough
so that he'd get into the really good schools, or have a really nice car, or
anything like that. But they weren't poor enough to give him any good
stories or challenges or struggles growing up. His life was as bland as bland
could be. Kevin Milquetoast from Milquetoast Wisconsin. His upbringing was
waspish, suburban and blank. He wasn't good looking enough to be stunning,
he wasn't ugly enough to have to be interesting. He never developed a
self-deprecating wit or bloodthirsty charisma.

His life so far was a leisurely stroll down the middle of the road. Not much
to see, not much to do, just a wide open avenue that didn't really go
anywhere.

He was tired of being understood, of being boring. He wanted adenture. So
this Spring Break, he set out to find it. He wanted to pile into his Toyota
Camry with a group of rowdy college friends and head across the border to
cut loose. He wanted to meet girls and stay up all night. He wanted to have
a story to tell when the guys were standing around the keg, telling tall
tales and waving their plastic cups at the girls.

But Kevin didn't have a group of rowdy college friends. He had friends that
studied together and played video games together and ate pizza pockets and
sometimes stayed up late playing boardgames.

And they all looked at him like he'd lost his mind when he talked about
heading down to Matamoros for Spring Break.

Wouldn't it be great, guys?

Sure, Kevin. It'd be something else.

But they didn't believe he'd actually do it. They never thought he'd cross
the border, and even if he did ... he wouldn't head to any Mexican
Nightclubs or Strip Bars.

And maybe he never would have gone, if it wasn't for the way they laughed at
him. For the way they dismissed him. Nobody took him seriously. But they
didn't call him a liar or dare him to do it or even raise an eyebrow. Sure,
Kevin, likely scenario. They, the people who knew him best, thought him
incapable of taking a simple holiday roadtrip to get wasted in another
country.

It's dangerous, man.

Precisely!

Why bother?

For the adventure. Don't you ever just want to ... I don't know ... *do*
something?

I guess. You want to throw a pizza pocket into the science oven for me?

Louis feels like he is keeping a caged animal inside his head. He can feel it pacing back and forth, gnawing at the bars, howling for its freedom.

The old tricks don't work. 

Louis is used to suppressing unwanted thoughts and feelings, he is used to keeping that dark and secret part of him locked away, down in the basement, where it can't do any harm, but the old tricks don't work. The locks are smashed. The doors are broken off the hinges.

He's used to suppressing part of himself. He's learned the tricks that keep his own temper down, that push back the tears, that suffocate the loneliness and smash out angst and joy alike.

He's learned to keep himself blank.

Louis Blake is a Blank Page.

Or, he *was* a blank page. That was then. Now things are different. There's a new force, a new passenger, a new prisoner. The old darkness, that was frightening. It was tough enough, certainly, to acknowledge and face the consequences of letting himself get carried away, of letting his emotional self sway him. 

His mother had taught him to be in control at all times. To be Blank. 

To keep the wolf in the cage.

But ... he *is* the wolf. The wolf isn't just *in* him, it *is* him. Louis has known this, since he has known anything. He's always known it, without the cluttering interference of words. He's know without knowing, without *needing* to know. For always.

He knew he always knew because one day the realization came to him and it was a total letdown. An anticlimax of the highest (or lowest) order. 

He'd had a fight with his mother. The treatment wasn't working, and it was time to move on, she said. She knew a guy, two states over, who had worked miracles in Georgia or Sudan or somewhere ... somewhere very far away.

Louis didn't want to pick up and move again. He didn't have friends, exactly, but there was this one kid ... this one kid, when he looked at him ... there was some kind of *recognition* in his eyes. It was stupid. It wasn't anything. Louis didn't even think about it. He remained a blank. But when his mother told him to pack his things, the wolf rose up and howled inside him.

Ma could tell. She could see it rising up inside him. You keep that beast down, Louis, she said. Lock that *evil* thing away deep down under the earth and don't you *dare* let it out.

Louis did as he was told, as he always did. But as the howls faded away inside of him, that other kid's face danced and flickered before his eyes like the reflection of the moon cast on choppy waters. It didn't fade gently, this time. The agitation increased until the image fractured into complete indecipherable chaos.

That's when Louis first put it into words. 

> The thing I am locking away, deep down below the earth ... that is *me.*   

As soon as he formulated the sentence, the realization came. He'd known this all along. The realization came floating into his mind clean and clear, in the form of a monosyllable. Maybe a word and maybe not, depending on context and who you asked:

> Duh.

<!-- 2015-02-08 | 10:48:15 -->

<!-- why am I so hard on my mom? Because she's a self-absorbed, insecure, alcoholic sociopath. at least those are the words I use to describe her in my head  -->

---


<!-- 2015-02-12 | 22:16:44 -->

What Louis felt now was different. 

This thing inside him didn't speak the same language. 

Language was a tough metaphor to use in this case, because the other, the first thing that he had inside him didn't really speak the language either. But it didn't matter. Because it *was him,* on some level. There were miscommunications and confusions. Difficulty in getting his point across when his analytical, linguistic consciousness didn't see eye to eye with his visceral, lymbic, emotional being. It was tough. It was good old wrestling with your feelings tough. But they were his feelings. Conflict arose when he tried to explain to the part of himself that didn't care about reasoning or logic why he shouldn't be feeling a particular emotion or sensation. It was frustrating and difficult at times, but he had tricks and techniques, and when it came right down to it, he was feeling the same things. He had access to both sides of the discussion, in a manner of speaking. He knew what was going on down there, even if he didn't have the common language to talk it down or disarm the situation.

This new thing didn't have any of the common ground. Louis had no idea what he was feeling any more. He'd catch a scent of something in the air, or see some flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye ... and next thing he knew, he'd be up on a table with his dick in his hand, pissing all over everything.

Why?

He couldn't say.

Was he upset about something? 

He didn't even know. 

This other thing inside of him, this new thing, this thing that had come along the night his mother died--was killed, Louis ... no use in skirting around the issue--was totally unpredictable.

And now, he was hurting people. He was killing animals. He'd be fine one minute and then an inexplicable panic would settle down over him and then ... he'd be tearing the flesh off a little dog. 

Only, he wouldn't really *get* it. He didn't know what he was doing. He just experienced a sort of blissed-out haze and eventually 'came to' covered in blood.

He hated that two word phrase, 'came to.' It felt like a cop out. When he told Doctor Bellamy, "that's all I remember ... I must have drifted off or blacked out, because that's all there was. Just a white haze until I came to. I was sitting on the floor of the cell--"

"The examination room."

"--with blood all over my hands," it felt like a cop out. And it wasn't completely accurate, anyhow. Coming back into himself was like an awakening, but not a sudden, one moment nothing and the next everything, sort of experience. It was a gradual affair. 

He could feel himself propelling forward through time, moving seamlessly
from one moment to the next.  He didn't vanish into a fog. He wasn't
swallowed up by it in one enveloping gulp.
The fog came after.  It was only when he started to question something that
the thread came loose.  Everything smooth, Louis totally engrossed in the
moment until something sparked a moment of reflection.  Who's blood is this? 
It could be mine, but then, it could also be ...  it could be ...  who?  ... 
what?  ...  blood?  Is that really what I was just thinking about?  No.  It
couldn't have been.  But then ...  what's this on my hands? I was just ...
in the middle of something. Something important. Something that made me
happy. 

It was like waking from a dream in which all the things you cared for most
had come together ... It was like waking from a dream in which Louis was
driving down the highway with his mother, they joked and laughed and he
waved a pair of pajama pants out the window, watching them flap and snap in
the hot highway air. They were moving again, but not an unwelcome,
oppressive move. Louis was too young to understand that there was something
*wrong* with him. They had such a good time, the two of them. Mother was
filled with hope and optimism.  They were headed off to something new,
something exciting. But then ...  the pajama pants slipped out of his
grasp and fluttered out behind them, flying through the air before falling
into the ditch on the side of the highway.  "Ma, stop the car," Louis
called, but the car kept on speeding.  Something blotted out the sun and the
road became dark.  The car eased across the center line and into the
oncoming traffic lane and Louis remembered that his mother was dead.  No one
was driving the car.  He grabbed onto the steering wheel from across the
center console.  He tried to bring the vehicle back into the other lane, but
the wheel fought him.  He willed the thing to slow down, but he couldn't
reach the brake and the car just kept going faster and faster.  The open
road narrowed and began to twist and wind and the earth fell away to the
left side as he entered a dark canyon ...

What just happened? Louis asks himself.

---

"Special K?" Kevin says. "I don't know. What is that?"

"Try it," says a Mexican wearing a spotless cowboy hat and an
impressively-tailored shirt, rolled up at the sleeves. "You'll like it."

"I was thinking maybe something that I can't get at home without a
perscription, like Percocet or I dunno, maybe Aderol?" Kevin's voice is
small, fading away into nothing. 

The Mexican hands him a silver straw and gestures to the mirrored surface of
the coffee table across which <!-- TODO: what color is Ketamine? --> cut lines of
greenish-white powder trace out arcane forms. "Like this," he says, closing
one of his nostrils with his thumb and tracing an invisible line across the
center of the room with his nose as it hisses with a steady intake of breath
that fills Kevin's ears with white noise. The breath goes on forever. The
Mexican's lungs fill and keep filling and Kevin feels himself being pulled
forward with a rush of air that comes in under the door,
through cracked windows, through gaps in the decaying siding of this
never-insulated warehouse.

The powder burns the sensitive membrane inside Kevin's nose. A rush of
adrenaline surges through him and his head snaps back and his eyes stretch
wider and wider and the colors of everything around him begin to saturate
and bleed.

The other men laugh.

How many of them are there? Kevin couldn't tell. He hadn't thought to count.
Maybe three or four? No more than ten.

"This one will make me safe, when I cross the border, yes?"

"Completely invisible," Don Oscuro says. He takes off his shirt and draws a
a machete from a leather sheath with a ringing scrape of steel. "Take his
hands. Tie them down."

Men remove the mirror from the makeshift table. The splintering surface of
the wood chafes Kevin and punctures his soft skin as the men lift him into
place, stretching him out on his back.

Kevin can't bring himself to move. It isn't the men holding him down. He
just can't convince his body to carry out his will.

"See the fear in his eyes? This is good. He will give strong magic for
you. You will be unstoppable."
