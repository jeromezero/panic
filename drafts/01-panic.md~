# panic 
## episode one: quid pro quo

### 01 - Intro

<!-- ACT ONE: Daisy, Tank & Louis enter into a medical trailer, seeking a calm space. Louis is suffering from the onset of a panic attack. (he's seen something that set him off) -->

<!-- ACT ONE: Daisy rummages through drawers and cabinets while Tank calls for a ride – they need to be picked up now. The person on the other end of the phone: You took him where? Are you crazy? Louis is dangerous. -->

"Give him some space," Tank said. "He needs some space. Let him breathe."

Louis was hyperventilating, seated in a padded leatherette examination chair with a chrome foot rest.

Daisy was wiping his face with a wad of wet paper towels, leaving little pills of torn paper stuck in his stubble.

Tank pushed her roughly aside, sending her caroming off the cabinetry. "I told you to give him some space," Tank said. "He needs to breathe."

"Fuck you, Tank," Daisy said, wiping blood from the corner of her mouth. "It was helping. And you fucking ... I bit my fucking tongue. Asshole."

Tank pressed his fingers to to Louis' wrist. His cell phone was wedged between his shoulder and his ear, and he watched the second hand of the clock on the wall.

"This is Tank Halloran," he said. "I'm going to need a--What? Yes, I'll hold. ... Fucking bitch! I lost count. What? No. Not you. You put me on hold. I didn't know you were still on the line. I need a--yes, I'll hold. Dammit, Daisy. Daisy, get away from there! Get out of the cupboard. Yes, thank you. I have a patient with--my name is Tank Halloran, Attendant Ward. Yes. No. No, I have two patients ... on a field trip, right, but I need a car to pick us up right away. Louis Blake is having an episode ... a panic attack."

### 02 – Complication / Conceit 

<!-- ACT TWO: Daisy gets upset – they can't go back yet. Tank promised he'd take her to the funhouse. They made a deal. Quid pro Quo. Despite Louis' nervous situation, he remains relatively calm, while those around him become more and more agitated.  -->

"No!" Daisy said. She lunged at Tank, and pulled his cell phone away from him. She threw it across the medical trailer. "We can't leave. Not until we see the funhouse. You promised, Tank. You promised."

Daisy's mascara was running. She stood facing Tank with her shoulders hunched, her hands balled up into little fists at her sides.

"Wait, just relax," Louis said, gulping down air. "Hang on a minute. Just relax. Lets just relax and stay here for a minute."

"No," Daisy said. "We have to get back out there. I don't want to be in this stupid hospital truck. We have to go to the funhouse. Tank, you promised. I put it in my mouth and you promised we could go to the funhouse."

"Daisy, hush," Tank said. "We don't talk about that around other people, remember? I'll make it up to you. I'll take you to the funhouse, but right now, we've got to take care of Louis. Okay?"

Daisy took a step toward Tank and reached toward his belt buckle. "Do you want me to do it again? I'll do it right now. Okay?"

<!-- ACT TWO: Louis doesn't want to go out there, because he saw something. Something about his teacher, something that started him having these panic episodes in the first place. He doesn't want to have another episode, and if he goes out there, he's going to have another episode. You don't want me to have another episode ... -->

"Calm down please," Louis said. "I don't want to go back out there. He's ..." Louis didn't know how to say it, but he had a problem. There was a guy out there, walking around without a shirt. It was unseasonably hot. Even this late in the day. Could he say it? How could he say he had a problem with a shirtless guy. They'd think he was burying himself in homosexual angst. He wasn't. Was he? But there was something about the guy. Something about his back. The scars? Whatever it was, something set Louis off. He couldn't control his breath. He got light headed, his chest hurt.

<!-- ACT TWO: Tank: I'll make it up to you, Daisy. I promise. I'll take you to the fair another time. This is an emergency. We've got to get Louis home. -->

"Daisy, stop that," Tank said. "I'll make it up to you. I promise. But first things first. We have to take care of--"

"Why did we have to bring stupid Louis along? I hate Louis. I hate you, Louis. Louis has Lupus. That's what's wrong with him. He doesn't belong with us. And he's stupid. Why did we have to bring him, anyway?"

"I couldn't very well bring you by yourself, Daisy. Now could I?" Tank said. "I'll make it up to you. But we've got to get Louis home. Okay?"

"I'll be okay," Louis said. He didn't sound okay. His breathing was getting worse. He was clutching at his chest with a pained look on his face. "It's getting dark," he said. "It's a full moon tonight, isn't it?" 

"Shut up about the moon already, Louis," Daisy said. "Always with the stupid moon with you,"

"Daisy, stop that," Tank said. "I'll make it up to you. But we're not going to see the funhouse today. Okay?"

"Okay? Okay? Okay? No! Not okay! Always with your stupid 'Okay?' Uuuugghhh. You are so fucking annoying. Wash your cock. It is dirty. It tastes terrible."

### 03 – Climax / Turning Point 	

<!-- ACT THREE: Daisy escalates. She is adamant about the funhouse. She finds a syringe and injects Tank with it. She tries to run out, but Tank grabs her and wrestles her to the ground. He reacts violently, and accidentally smacks her one in the face. -->

"Get a hold of yourself, Daisy," Tank said. 

She stared back at him with a look of petulant defiance in her eyes. Neither of them spoke for a long moment. Louis' breath was loud, ragged and desperate. It competed with the sounds of the fair going on outside the trailer--indiscernible melodies played on a distant fiddle blending with amplified voices and the buzz of machinery and the clang of bells.

Daisy was the first to look away. She broke eye contact and crossed her arms under her breasts and she walked into the corner of the trailer, where she could look out the window. "You promised you'd take me to the funhouse," she muttered under her breath.

Tank ignored her mutterings and crossed to the opposite corner to pick his phone up from the floor.

Daisy started to rummage through the cabinets while Tank shouted into his phone, "Hello! Can you hear me? Hello? The damn thing is broken. Great, Daisy. You broke my fucking phone, you stupid bitch--"

Daisy ripped the plastic away from a single-use syringe and lifted it over her head. She screamed and charged at Tank, taking him by surprise as she sank the needle into the flesh where the top of his shoulder met his neck.

"Holy fuck," Tank dropped his phone and wrapped his arms around Daisy, pinning her arms to her sides. He lifted her up into the air and slammed her into the cabinets. They fell together into a tangled heap on the floor.

<!-- ACT THREE: Tank: You know how fucking dangerous that is? What the fuck did you hit me with? He's sweating and a little nauseous and really pumped up. Epinephrine. Adrenaline. Are you stupid? -->

Louis tried to talk some sense into them, to calm them down. "I don't think this is a good idea," he said. "If you don't calm down, there's no telling ..." 

"You trying to kill me, you bitch?" Tank said. "Just what the fuck do you think you are doing?" He pressed her down onto the linoleum-covered floor. He held her wrists together with one hand and pinned them above her head. With his other hand, he pulled the syringe from his shoulder and looked at it. "Adrenaline. Are you stupid?"

<!-- ACT THREE: EMTs come in (it's their trailer): What the hell is going on here? Tank's got Daisy pinned in a compromising position. She shouts “Rape!” -->

The strawberry light of sunset shot into the trailer as the three EMTs opened the door to rush inside. 

"What's going on in here?" they say. "Is everything all right? We let you use trailer in good faith. You said you needed space ... but what is this?"

"Rape is what it is," said Daisy. "Get this asshole off of me."

### 04 – Falling Action / Suspense / Reversal / Spiral / Escalation		

<!-- ACT FOUR: EMTs and Tank – what is going on here? -everything is fine. I've called the hospital. They're sending a car. Just need to keep him calm until they arrive. -Him? What about her? -She's agitated, but she'll get over it. She's fine. It's the guy we should worry about. But I know how to work with him. I know how to calm him (he doesn't respond well to sedatives [or, not the sedatives they have on hand in the trailer]) -->

"What's that smell?" One of the EMTs said. "Is that sulfur?"

"No. Burning matches. Magnesium. You lighting up in here?"

"It's not like that," Tank said. "It's not what it looks like. She is my patient."

"I thought you were having problems with the other one. What is she doing pinned to the floor?"

"I've called for a car, I think," Tank said. "I tried to, but this one smashed my phone and stuck me in the neck with an epi-pen."

"You look a little shaky," said an EMT.

"I'm fine, I think," Tank said.

"You'd better let that girl go."

"You going to behave, Daisy?" Tank said.

"Ugh. You are such an ass," Daisy said. "I'll behave."

Tank got up and moved his body away from her before he released her wrists. 

"Where did you say you work?" An EMT asked.

"Seven Oaks," Tank said.

"Up at the asylum, eh?"

"Just bringing these two out for a day trip."

"Day's about done."

<!-- ACT FOUR: While Tank is talking with the EMTs, Daisy messes with Louis, pressing her tits in his face, teasing him, alternating between encouraging him and berating him—trying to convince him to freak out, or to take her to the fun house -->

While Tank spoke with the EMTs, Daisy kicked off from the cabinets and slid across the linoleum floor to the base of Louis' examination chair. She reached for Louis' hand, but Louis jerked it away as soon as she touched it. 

He had been sitting with his eyes pressed tightly together, counting under his breath, which was still ragged and gasping.

Daisy pulled herself up via the armrest instead. She pressed her breasts to Louis's legs, sliding them up his body as she lifted herself into a kneeling position in front of him.

"I've always liked you, Louis," she said.

Louis didn't yet open his eyes. His mouth kept working, pushing numbers out his trembling lips as he shook his head back and forth.

"You know ... we could slip out of here while they are talking. If you take me to the fun house, we'll have some time alone together. It could be *real* fun, Louis. Come on."

"I don't think we should go out there," Louis said. "I don't think it's a good idea. I saw ... there's a man out there. With scars on his back. Just like ... like I saw in the desert."

"What is it with you? You are always going on about the moon and the desert ... but no one ever lets you talk about it. They tell you to calm down, or they give you a sedative. What happened to you out there? Who had scars on his back? Like whip marks or something?"

"No. Not whip marks. It was different. A pattern. There was a .... I don't know. I don't want to talk about it. I want to go home."

"We can't go home, Louis. Not until I see the funhouse. Don't you want to see the funhouse? The moon is rising now, Louis. It'll reflect in the mirrors. You will be surrounded by its light. We can find the guy with the scars. He'll be there."

<!-- ACT FOUR: Louis reaches his breaking point. He needs to get outside. He needs to find out what it is, exactly, he saw out there. He needs to find his old teacher. His old teacher would know whats happening to him. He would know what to do. Why did he leave me like this? -->

"No! I don't want to see ... I don't want to go there. I don't want to go back. Where is the Doctor? Why did he leave me like this? He was supposed to make everything better. He was supposed to make everything good. But ... there was so much blood."


###05 – Catastrophe / conclusion / resolution / denouement		

<!-- ACT FIVE: Louis has had it. His temper flares. His vision goes red. “Oh shit, here it comes.” What happens? The same thing that happens every time his vision goes red. Louis blacks out and PEOPLE GET HURT. -->

"Louis ... What is wrong with your eyes?" Daisy said. "Louis ... I didn't mean anything by it. Are you okay? We don't have to go ... I can ... I mean ... forget the funhouse."

"I can smell it," Louis said, his voice quavering and raspy.

"What? What are you talking about?" Daisy backed away from Louis without getting up. She fell back onto her ass and shuffled away, pushing with her hands and feet alike until she backed into the cabinets.

Everyone was looking at Louis now. 

"His blood. His soul. He has the blood of a sinner," Louis said, his voice now a veritable growl. "I can't resist the ... goddamn it. Get out of my throat!"

Louis seemed to fill the medical trailer. Though he didn't appear to physically change, to grow from one moment to the next, his presence expanded. All attention snapped to Louis. The pudgy, asthmatic kid who had been sitting in the examination chair was nowhere to be seen. In his place was a force of darkness, a concentration of abstract force. Glowing eyes and deep guttural	 breathing and heaving muscle and sinew flexed and suddenly exploded from the chair.

The EMTs turned to run. One of them almost made it to the door. He was struck down by Tank's severed head. Severed is too clean a word, for a good portion of the spinal column still clung to the back of Tank's skull.

They hardly had time to scream before the medical trailer ran awash with blood. kq
