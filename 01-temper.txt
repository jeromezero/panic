Louis Blake is disoriented—he's being questioned, tied up in a walk-in cooler.

Tank calls the doctor “we're having an issue. Postpone the pickup—working on it. Don't worry. It's under control. Just a little more time and we'll have it all sorted out.” He hangs up. Smacks Louis around some. “Where's the MacGuffin!? What did you do with it?”

Louis talks a lot, but says nothing about the MacGuffin. He wants to meet the Doctor. He's been sick—afraid something is going on in his brain. The Doctor can help, he thinks. He didn't have anything to do with the MacGuffin's disappearance. He showed up at the bar, and doesn't remember what happened next. Blacked out … this is what's been happening to me. The doctor can help me, right? Next thing I know … I'm naked and tied up in the cooler …

Tank has a violent outburst. Trying to teach Thug Number One a lesson. Thug was responsible for the joint last night. “I left you in charge,” Tank says. “I'm under a lot of pressure.” He accidentally beats Thug to death.

Daisy holds a gun in her shaking hands. Aims it at Tank. “I've had enough of this,” she says. “I've had enough of your abuse.” CLICK.

Tank says “You know how dangerous it is to point a gun at somebody? You think I keep that thing loaded? You know how dangerous it is to point a gun at somebody? Even an unloaded gun?” He takes the gun and smacks her around. “We'll finish this later,” he says. “We'll do the kiss and make up stuff later. Right now, I gotta work, baby.”

Chaos – thugs come in with news. No one can find the MacGuffin. They're tearing the place apart, but to no avail. During the chaos, Daisy says to Louis “can you drive a stick? I need somebody to drive.”

Louis tries to calm everyone down. “I hate all this chaos and violence. Just keep it together, everyone. The doctor is gonna be here soon, right? You can pull it together and keep the appointment, right? Find the MacGuffin and get yourselves together. Tank is fighting with his own thugs—they've had enough of his rule by intimidation and terror. What he's done to Number One is terrible. They won't stand for it any longer. Daisy is hitting on Louis, rubbing her tits in his face, trying to convince him to drive for her—she's got the macguffin in the trunk of a car, out on the street, but she can't drive a stick. Thug Number One was supposed to drive for her … but Louis could drive instead …

The doctor calls. Cancels the whole thing.

Louis has had it. His temper flares. His vision goes red. “Oh shit, here it comes.” What happens? The same thing that happens every time his vision goes red. Louis blacks out and PEOPLE GET HURT.
