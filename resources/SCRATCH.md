DOCTOR DURWARD
Everything feels like a waste of time to me now, everything feels like there is very much pressure. I hate this feeling of too much pressure, to serious all the time. Too much stress. The stress itself doesn't do any good. The path has to be walked every day, but not with panic or pressure, the path has to be walked with ease, Louis. If you want to get better, you need to apply yourself.

"You have to be careful of what you think about," Louis' mother told him. "Your condition makes you especially succeptible to obsessive behaviors. You have to learn to let things go. To let them roll off you like water off a duck's back."

Takes it in without words. Takes it in and amplifies it. 

It's like a reservoir of raw energy. When something excites him, the place fills with excitement and threatens to overwhelm Louis. If he gets angry, the dark corner of him fills with white hot rage and spills over into Louis, taking away his ability to reason. Whatever the emotion, whatever the feeling, the dark space responds in kind. It amplifies his emotional state and thrusts it back at him, louder and stronger and louder and stronger, taking over. It creates a feedback circuit and screams out with raw physical / emotional energy until Louis can hear nothing else. 

His mother helped him to recognize this space within him. She showed him tricks. She showed him how to calm himself. How to cut the feedback circuit. How to avoid losing himself. But now she is gone. And since she's been gone ...

Since the incident at the patrol station, the dark space has changed. Louis can't see into it ... that is the same, but there is something different about the feelings that come from it. There is something moving around in there. It is often silent when it should be loud. It is unpredictable. It doesn't respond to the tricks he's learned. What has worked to calm him--to prevent the darkness from spilling over and screaming so loud in Louis' head that he can't hear anything--doesn't work any longer. The effectiveness has been decreasing, fluctuating with the phases of the moon. Sometimes Louis can hear something whining in there, something scratching at the walls, something sniffing at the darkness. That has never been. 

Louis' mother knew what to tell him, in the past. She described the darkness to him and gave him the tools to live with it. Most of the time. The tools with which to grapple, to struggle. She would know about this latest development. What was happening? Why the changes. His mother would know. He would ask her, and she would tell him what was happening within him. Would give him words, a metaphor by which he could more effectively understand the latest development of his illness. But she wasn't around. He lost her at the Patrol Station Incident. Now everything is different. Louis is alone. 

When Louis enters the asylum, he is not welcomed. Much to Durward's surprise, the other patients or 'guests' rattle their doors, smash their plates and scream at Louis. They sense something inside him. Something lurking inside of Louis' dark place.

Louis can sense the dark place in one of the other guests. It resonates and recognizes its presence in the other. "It is not another dark place, but the same," someone said. "You have a window inside you. I have a window too. They are different windows, but they look out onto the same space, onto the same darkness."

But that other guest now rails against Louis. "There is something in you ... something terrible," he says. "Get it away. Get away."

They have a showdown, a territorial showdown in which Louis is chased from the property

If there is anything to be said for the situation, anything at all, it is this:

I leave a large blank space here, so that this may be filled in later, by someone with more acute understanding of the situation than I. I assume this will come with distance and perspective. Perhaps someone with an advanced temporal advantage will be able to put the whole thing into perspective and draw out the appropriate themes and threads. But for now, I am stuck in the middle of it all, and am unable, as the saying goes, to see the forest for the trees.
