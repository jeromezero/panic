Again, Louis sat in a garden. But this was a very different garden. A private space. A space for himself, which he never shared with anyone. 

It was a lush, rich garden, with towering old oaks. Didn't those used to be alder? Louis thought they had been, but he couldn't quite remember. He never thought of the old grove of trees as Oaks, but yes ... there they were, a grove of seven oak trees in a loose cluster off to one side of the garden. 

Flowering vines climbed the gnarled old trees. Moonlight Shizophragma. Of course.

"Describe your surroundings," said a voice somewhere far outside the garden. It was Doctor Bellamy's voice.

"Hang on," Louis said. "It's changed."

"And what has changed about it?" the doctor asked. "Is that unusual?"

"No. It's normally ... I ... yes, it is unusual. Normally, it's different. I mean, it's the same. It's always the same. But now ..."

"Is it because I am here?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I don't think so. I think it's something else. I don't know for sure. It's just. Usually, the trees are Alder trees."

"And now?"

"Now, there is a grove of Oaks. Seven Oak trees standing off to the ... and they are leaning over me. Reaching around the garden ... not surrounding it, exactly, but ... moving  ... and there are flowering vines. Vines from your garden here. They were never in my garden before, but now they are."

"Many people, when they visit an inner refuge, like your garden, they often find little ... manifestations, or representations of things that have been on their minds ... or otherwise in their lives."

"No. Not here. This place ... I'm not sure, exactly--not objectively--but this garden ... is the place where my mother and my father ... she told me about it. I never saw it, but it's always been the way she described it. The way I pictured it. The way I've imagined. But something is different."

"Did our garden here have a strong impact on you? How do you feel, when you see things have changed here, in your own garden? Do you feel threatened? Invaded? Encroached upon?"

"I don't know. I shouldn't be doing this."

"Relax, Louis. Take a few deep breaths. Settle into the tranquility of the garden. Let the calm, let the peace of it wash over--"

"Please. Stop that. I don't need you to guide me through this. You wanted me to show you how I do this. You wanted me to share my relaxation techniques with you. To show you the dark mirror. To show you where I've locked it away. I can show you, but you shouldn't be here. It will be much easier for me if you don't talk at me, if you don't try to guide me through anything. Just listen, please."

> I've never done this before. I am not used to an outside presence. And now ... everything is different here. Not everything, but things. There are some things. Some changes have crept in. The oak trees, the flowering Moonlight vines. There is a stillness to the place. 
The birds ... the insects ...

> The air is still. The sweet scent ... flowers or ... decay ... is heavy. It is not humid. It is not dry. But there is something ... some weight pressing in on me. I cannot see the sun. The sky is grey, featureless. There are no shadows. The light comes from ... not everywhere, but not ... it comes from nowhere. It is heavy, like the air. It presses in, presses down on my skin. I can feel its weight on my face, pressing my eyelids down.

> I am walking now, between the oak trees. Following the narrow dirt path. It winds out of the garden, toward the mountain. Grasses give way to shrubs and evergreens. Stones. It enters a gully. There are still no shadows, but the air is even thicker, more difficult to penetrate. I have been here before, but I don't recognize anything. That isn't right, exactly. I recognize something ... but I can't quite pinpoint what it is. There is something oddly familiar about the place, yet it is alien. A murmuring simmer of dejas-vu in the back of my skull buzzes like the insects that I should be hearing. The conspicuously absent insects.

> I have been this way before. It used to be familiar to me, but now it is overgrown. It is overgrown, but something has been here, recently. It has smashed through the years of growth. The years of growth, I would expect. But someone or something has been along this path. Has been using it. A tree, fallen across the path, has been torn apart. Splinters of freshly-exposed wood are scattered and strewn about.

> I am nearing the entrance to the cave. It was hidden. Years before, I hid it, piled rocks one by one. The obscuring rocks have been scattered and smashed. Fresh rock-dust coats the leaves of sage brush. I had nailed boards across the entrance, years before ...

> I had sealed the mirror inside. Locked it away. I nailed boards to the old support beams. I piled rocks in front of the boards. I poured dirt and earth over the rocks so that the entrance disappeared into the hillside. But now ... the earth and dirt are gone. Eroded. Washed away by the years. The stones are scattered, the pile reduced to nothing. The boards are smashed. Broken and splintered like the tree fallen across the path.

"Smashed outward? Has something escaped?" the doctor's voice betrays concern.

"No," Louis says. "The boards have been smashed *in.* Something has broken *in."*
