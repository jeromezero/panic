I'd love to be consumed by something worthwhile. To have an ounce of brilliance fall from the tip of my bleeding pen.

Such is life, this desperate life.

If only one would wander into the next. If only I could force myself to produce something logical and cohesive and wonderful.

But my efforts are lackluster

I spent four hundred twenty one point five six hours on writing projects in 2014.

What do I have to show for it?

Many draft pages. Some more wisdom? Deeper debt. 

Yes yes yes. A wider understanding of workflows and available technologies that can be bent to the task at hand. What is this 'task at hand'? I speak of?

Is it vainglorious masturbation?

Perhaps.

What is it to be 'vainglorious?'

It is essentially to be vain, isn't it?

The Merriam-Webster online calls it:

> having or showing too much pride in your abilities or achievements 

on to the dog and pony show.

> The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events.[2] Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was “Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show,” started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled “Gentry’s Equine and Canine Paradox.” It started small, but evolved into a full circus show.[3] Other early dog and pony shows included Morris’ Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt’s Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).

> By the latter part of the 20th century, the original meaning of the term had been largely lost.

Thus spake Wikipedia. 

That last line is rather sad, isn't it?

But I do roather like the "Equine and Canine Paradox." That has a certain post-victorian charm to it, I think.

Well, whether you are in agreement or dis, it is time to depart this scenario.

On to the Equine and Canine Paradox, gentlemen. We must away.
