What is wrong with me? I cannot say. There is something eating away at my confidence, at my focus. My powers of concentration are eroding. 

I hear voices. They speak at the edge of my awareness. They are moving in and out of each other, talking under and over each other, sparkling with good cheer and conflict, together. They laugh like old friends grinding axes under their words, seeking out soft spots, seeking leverage.

I imagine this is no encounter that can be won. This is an ongoing war. There is a constant give and take that has been played out time and time again. It will be played out on into the future. It is the foundation of their friendship. 

Perhaps one day, it will change. Perhaps, one day, when they are old, one of them will lose the knife edge of mental clarity, and won't be able to keep up the fight. Dementia will take the fight out of their friendship, and what then will be left?
