# Louis' Mother gives him Advice

"You have to be careful of what you think about," Louis' mother told him. "Your condition makes you especially succeptible to obsessive behaviors. You have to learn to let things go. To let them roll off you like water off a duck's back."

It's like a reservoir of raw energy. When something excites him, the place fills with excitement and threatens to overwhelm Louis.

Louis' mother knew what to tell him, in the past. She described the darkness to him and gave him the tools to live with it. Most of the time. The tools with which to grapple, to struggle.

Now everything is different. Louis is alone.
