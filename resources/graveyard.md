# Louis' Mother gives him Advice

"You have to be careful of what you think about," Louis' mother told him. "Your condition makes you especially succeptible to obsessive behaviors. You have to learn to let things go. To let them roll off you like water off a duck's back."

Takes it in without words. Takes it in and amplifies it. 

It's like a reservoir of raw energy. When something excites him, the place fills with excitement and threatens to overwhelm Louis. If he gets angry, the dark corner of him fills with white hot rage and spills over into Louis, taking away his ability to reason. Whatever the emotion, whatever the feeling, the dark space responds in kind. It amplifies his emotional state and thrusts it back at him, louder and stronger and louder and stronger, taking over. It creates a feedback circuit and screams out with raw physical / emotional energy until Louis can hear nothing else. 

His mother helped him to recognize this space within him. She showed him tricks. She showed him how to calm himself. How to cut the feedback circuit. How to avoid losing himself. But now she is gone. And since she's been gone ...

Louis' mother knew what to tell him, in the past. She described the darkness to him and gave him the tools to live with it. Most of the time. The tools with which to grapple, to struggle. She would know about this latest development. What was happening? Why the changes. His mother would know. He would ask her, and she would tell him what was happening within him. Would give him words, a metaphor by which he could more effectively understand the latest development of his illness. But she wasn't around. He lost her at the Patrol Station Incident. Now everything is different. Louis is alone. 

# doc bellamy finds louis in the garden

When someone draped a blanket over him, Louis hoped it was Doctor Durward. She was a woman, but her gender didn't seem to matter. It wasn't that Lois would rather be seen naked by a woman--no, that was a terrifying thought--but Doctor Durward seemed to be beyond sex and gender. She was distant and cool, but kind and protective. Something about her made Louis feel safe and welcome and cared for. 

But as Louis pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, he saw that it was the other doctor. Doctor Bellamy. The stern and judgmental doctor.

Louis looked up, and Doctor Bellamy was standing with his arms folded across his chest, staring down at Louis, a stern and judgmental look on his face.
