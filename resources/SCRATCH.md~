# the structure and all that shit

There should be something simple and direct about the structure. Especially
if I don't really know where I am going with anything.

That's not right. I do know largely where I am going. I just don't know how
to get there.

This is the thing: I think Louis should get out on his own and then have
different adventures as he travels around the country. He meets some folks,
makes some friends, trouble comes along, and he spazzes the fuck out just in
time to save his new friends from whatever trouble they were getting into. 

Fine. I can deal with that. It can be fun, even.

But a few things need to happen for me to get him out of the social
constructs in which he is currently enmeshed.

But why wait, really? Here he is. There is the option to get this going now.

He is in the asylum. The doc is what the fuck. It's time for me to go to
bed, I think. I love the work we are doing here, really I do, kids, but this
has got to come to a close about now. I am tired in the brainpants. There is
no other way for me to describe this to you. I can't fight this feeling
anymore!

So much to do, so little have I done. That's what it feels like on the
surface. I get frustrated and distracted by techish toys. And for what? 

To keep some excitement flowing, I guess. I don't mind the excitement
feature or function of my life. I love them all.

What am I trying to accomplish in the asylum? Louis has led a sheltered
life. There is something different about him. He doesn't know his father.
His mother is dead. She was a smart lady, but she took him all around the
country without ever setting down roots, as she searched for cures for
Louis' condition. And now, he is having to confront some part of him that he
locked away for most of his life, only to find that some other force or
entity has set up shop there ... 

And Shannon Unger recognizes some kinship between them, though shannon is an
old junkie. 

But then, when it seems Shannon can be an ally to Louis, Shannon gets a whif
of the new force that's set up shop in Louis' head, and he doesn't like it.
So he freaks out.
